Genesis 1 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
2 And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
3 And God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.
4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6 And God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”
7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.
8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
9 And God said, “Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.
10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good.
11 And God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth”; and it was so.
12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind; and God saw that it was good.
13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.
14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years;
15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth”; and it was so.
16 And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.
17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
20 And God said, “Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.”
21 And God created great whales and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and God saw that it was good.
22 And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth.”
23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
24 And God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind”; and it was so.
25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind; and God saw that it was good.
26 And God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”
27 So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.
28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”
29 And God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat”; and it was so.
31 And God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Genesis 2 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
2 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2 And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.
4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,
5 and before every plant of the field was in the earth, and before every herb of the field grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
8 And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.
9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became four heads.
11 The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
12 And the gold of that land is good, and there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
13 And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
15 And the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;
17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.”
18 And the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper meet for him.”
19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper meet for him.
21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.
22 And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman and brought her unto the man.
23 And Adam said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”
24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.
25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
Genesis 3 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
3 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, “Yea, hath God said, ‘Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”
2 And the woman said unto the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,
3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, ‘Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,lest ye die.’”
4 And the serpent said unto the woman, “Ye shall not surely die;
5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”
6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and ate, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he ate.
7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves things to gird about.
8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
9 And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, “Where art thou?”
10 And he said, “I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.”
11 And He said, “Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?”
12 And the man said, “The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”
13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, “What is this that thou hast done?” And the woman said, “The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.”
14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, “Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her Seed; It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel.”
16 Unto the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.”
17 And unto Adam He said, “Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, ‘Thou shalt not eat of it,’ cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”
20 And Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22 And the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live for ever”—
23 therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24 So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Genesis 4 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
4 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man from the Lord.”
2 And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
3 And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.
4 And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering;
5 but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
6 And the Lord said unto Cain, “Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen?
7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”
8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.
9 And the Lord said unto Cain, “Where is Abel thy brother?” And he said, “I know not. Am I my brother’s keeper?”
10 And He said, “What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground.
11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.
12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength. A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be on the earth.”
13 And Cain said unto the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.
14 Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth. And it shall come to pass that every one who findeth me shall slay me.”
15 And the Lord said unto him, “Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
16 And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod to the east of Eden.
17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
18 And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.
19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
20 And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and of those who have cattle.
21 And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who handle the harp and organ.
22 And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
23 And Lamech said unto his wives, “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech! For I have slain a man for my wounding, and a young man for my hurt.
24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.”
25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son and called his name Seth. “For God,” said she, “hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.”
26 And to Seth also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.
Genesis 5 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
5 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him.
2 Male and female created He them, and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created.
3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.
4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.
5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
6 And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enosh.
7 And Seth lived after he begot Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
9 And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.
10 And Enosh lived after he begot Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
11 And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
12 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalaleel.
13 And Cainan lived after he begot Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters.
14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begot Jared.
16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begot Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.
17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
18 And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and he begot Enoch.
19 And Jared lived after he begot Enoch eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begot Methuselah.
22 And Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years.
24 And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.
25 And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begot Lamech.
26 And Methuselah lived after he begot Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begot sons and daughters.
27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
28 And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begot a son.
29 And he called his name Noah, saying, “This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed.”
30 And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begot sons and daughters.
31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
32 And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis 6 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
6 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them,
2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took for themselves wives of all whom they chose.
3 And the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for he also is flesh; yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.”
4 There were giants on the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagining of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6 And the Lord repented that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him in His heart.
7 And the Lord said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air, for I repent that I have made them.”
8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
10 And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
12 And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13 And God said unto Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14 Make thee an ark of gopherwood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt cover it within and without with pitch.
15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16 A window shalt thou make for the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17 And behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven; and every thing that is on the earth shall die.
18 But with thee will I establish My covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife and thy sons’ wives with thee.
19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive.
21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be food for thee and for them.”
22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
Genesis 7 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
7 And the Lord said unto Noah, “Come thou and all thy house into the ark, for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation.
2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.”
5 And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him.
6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
9 there went in two by two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female as God had commanded Noah.
10 And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, that same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark—
14 they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.
16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him; and the Lord shut him in.
17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
18 And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered.
20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, and the mountains were covered.
21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
22 all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, all that was on the dry land, died.
23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth. And Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
Genesis 8 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
8 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were assuaged.
2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained.
3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually, and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.
7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
8 Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
9 but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
10 And he stayed yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
11 And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
12 And he stayed yet another seven days and sent forth the dove, which returned not again unto him any more.
13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
15 And God spoke unto Noah, saying,
16 “Go forth from the ark, thou and thy wife, and thy sons and thy sons’ wives with thee.
17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.”
18 And Noah went forth, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him.
19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
20 And Noah built an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
21 And the Lord smelled a sweet savor; and the Lord said in His heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.”
Genesis 9 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
9 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth.
2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
4 “But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require. At the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.
6 Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man.
7 And you, be ye fruitful and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.”
8 And God spoke unto Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
9 “And I, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you,
10 and with every living creature that is with you — of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth.
11 And I will establish My covenant with you: Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.”
12 And God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
13 I do set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth.
14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud.
15 And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16 And the rainbow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.”
17 And God said unto Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”
18 And the sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.
19 These are the three sons of Noah, and from them was the whole earth overspread.
20 And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.
21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren outside.
23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
25 And he said, “Cursed be Canaan! A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.”
26 And he said, “Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.”
28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
Genesis 10 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
10 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.
2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.
5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided into their lands, every one after his own tongue, according to their families, into their nations.
6 And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim, and Put and Canaan.
7 And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah, and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.
8 And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth.
9 He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, “Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.”
10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
11 Out of that land he went forth to Assyria, and built Nineveh and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city.
13 And Mizraim begot Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim
14 and Pathrusim and Casluhim (out of whom came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.
15 And Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth;
16 and the Jebusite and the Amorite, and the Girgashite
17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite and the Sinite,
18 and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; and as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha.
20 These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their countries and in their nations.
21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.
22 The children of Shem: Elam and Asshur, and Arphaxad and Lud and Aram.
23 And the children of Aram: Uz and Hul, and Gether and Mash.
24 And Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber.
25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.
26 And Joktan begot Almodad and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth and Jerah,
27 and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah,
28 and Obal and Abimael and Sheba,
29 and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
30 And their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar, a mount of the east.
31 These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.
32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood.
Genesis 11 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
11 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
3 And they said one to another, “Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
4 And they said, “Come, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.”
5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built.
6 And the Lord said, “Behold, the people are one and they have all one language, and this they begin to do; and now nothing will be withheld from them which they have imagined to do.
7 Come, let Us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”
8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off building the city.
9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel [that is, Confusion], because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood;
11 and Shem lived after he begot Arphaxad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begot Salah;
13 and Arphaxad lived after he begot Salah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
14 And Salah lived thirty years and begot Eber;
15 and Salah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
16 And Eber lived four and thirty years and begot Peleg;
17 and Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.
18 And Peleg lived thirty years and begot Reu;
19 and Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.
20 And Reu lived two and thirty years and begot Serug;
21 and Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
22 And Serug lived thirty years and begot Nahor;
23 and Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years and begot Terah;
25 and Nahor lived after he begot Terah one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
26 And Terah lived seventy years and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot.
28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
29 And Abram and Nahor took for themselves wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran and dwelt there.
32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis 12 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
12 Now the Lord had said unto Abram, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee.
2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.
3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”
4 So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5 And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan they came.
6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land.
7 And the Lord appeared unto Abram and said, “Unto thy seed will I give this land.” And there built he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
10 And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the land.
11 And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, “Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon.
12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live because of thee.”
14 And it came to pass, when Abram had come into Egypt, that the Egyptians beheld the woman, that she was very fair.
15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
16 And he treated Abram well for her sake; and he had sheep and oxen and heasses, and menservants and maidservants, and sheasses and camels.
17 And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
19 Why saidst thou, ‘She is my sister,’ so I might have taken her to me for a wife? Now therefore behold thy wife; take her and go thy way.”
20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.
Genesis 13 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
13 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
4 unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first; and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.
5 And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents.
6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
7 And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle; and the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelled then in the land.
8 And Abram said unto Lot, “Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.
9 Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah), even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto Zoar.
11 Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.
12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
14 And the Lord said unto Abram after Lot was separated from him, “Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
15 for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed for ever.
16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.”
18 Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.
Genesis 14 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
14 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,
2 that these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
3 All these were joined together in the Vale of Siddim, which is the Salt Sea.
4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
6 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
7 And they returned and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites, who dwelt in Hazezontamar.
8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar), and they joined battle with them in the Vale of Siddim,
9 against Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and against Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar — four kings against five.
10 And the Vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there, and those who remained fled to the mountain.
11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their victuals, and went their way.
12 And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods and departed.
13 And there came one who had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt on the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house (three hundred and eighteen), and pursued them unto Dan.
15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods, and the women also and the people.
17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (which is the King’s Dale) after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings who were with him.
18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was the priest of the Most High God.
19 And he blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth;
20 and blessed be the Most High God, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.” And he gave him tithes of all.
21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, “Give me the persons, and take the goods for thyself.”
22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the Most High God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23 that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe strap, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,‘I have made Abram rich’”
24 except only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.”
Genesis 15 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
15 After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, “Fear not, Abram. I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.”
2 And Abram said, “Lord God, what wilt Thou give me, seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?”
3 And Abram said, “Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed; and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.”
4 And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, “This shall not be thine heir, but he that shall come forth out of thine own loins shall be thine heir.”
5 And He brought him forth outdoors and said, “Look now toward heaven and count the stars, if thou be able to number them.” And He said unto him, “So shall thy seed be.”
6 And he believed in the Lord; and He accounted it to him for righteousness.
7 And He said unto him, “I am the Lord who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.”
8 And he said, “Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?”
9 And He said unto him, “Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a shegoat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”
10 And he took unto Him all these, and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another; but the birds divided he not.
11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13 And He said unto Abram, “Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years.
14 And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried at a good old age.
16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.”
17 And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between those pieces.
18 On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the River Euphrates:
19 the Kenites and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites,
20 and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaim,
21 and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites.”
Genesis 16 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
16 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children; and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
2 And Sarai said unto Abram, “Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go in unto my maid. It may be that I may obtain children by her.” And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
3 And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
5 And Sarai said unto Abram, “My wrong be upon thee. I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. The Lord judge between me and thee.”
6 But Abram said unto Sarai, “Behold, thy maid is in thy hand. Do to her as it pleaseth thee.” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her face.
7 And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.
8 And he said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? And whither wilt thou go?” And she said, “I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.”
9 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, “Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.”
10 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, “I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.”
11 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, “Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name Ishmael [that is, God shall hear], because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.
12 And he will be a wild man. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.”
13 And she called the name of the Lord who spoke unto her: “Thou God seest me.” For she said, “Have I also here looked upon Him that seeth me?”
14 Therefore the well was called Beerlahairoi [that is, The well of Him that liveth and seeth me]. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
15 And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called his son’s name, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
Genesis 17 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
17 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him, “I am the Almighty God. Walk before Me, and be thou perfect.
2 And I will make My covenant between Me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.”
3 And Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him, saying,
4 “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
7 And I will establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
8 And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”
9 And God said unto Abraham, “Thou shalt keep My covenant, therefore, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations.
10 This is My covenant which ye shall keep between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every manchild among you shall be circumcised.
11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between Me and you.
12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every manchild in your generations, he that is born in the house or bought with money from any stranger who is not of thy seed.
13 He that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14 And the uncircumcised manchild whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.”
15 And God said unto Abraham, “As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
16 And I will bless her and give thee a son also by her. Yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.”
17 Then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?”
18 And Abraham said unto God, “O that Ishmael might live before Thee!”
19 And God said, “Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed, and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. Twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
21 But My covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.”
22 And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money from the stranger, were circumcised with him.
Genesis 18 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
18 And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
2 And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground
3 and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.
4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree;
5 and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts. After that ye shall pass on, for therefor are ye come to your servant.” And they said, “So do, as thou hast said.”
6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, “Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.”
7 And Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf, tender and good, and gave it unto a young man, and he hastened to dress it.
8 And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
9 And they said unto him, “Where is Sarah thy wife?” And he said, “Behold, in the tent.”
10 And he said, “I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.” And Sarah heard it from the tent door, which was behind him.
11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”
13 And the Lord said unto Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?’
14 Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.”
15 Then Sarah denied, saying, “I laughed not,” for she was afraid. And He said, “Nay, but thou didst laugh.”
16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
17 And the Lord said, “Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do,
18 seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.”
20 And the Lord said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,
21 I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which has come unto Me; and if not, I will know.”
22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.
23 And Abraham drew near and said, “Wilt Thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
24 Perhaps there be fifty righteous within the city; wilt Thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25 That be far from Thee to do in this manner — to slay the righteous with the wicked; and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from Thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
26 And the Lord said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.”
27 And Abraham answered and said, “Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, I, who am but dust and ashes.
28 Perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt Thou destroy all the city for lack of five?” And He said, “If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.”
29 And he spoke unto Him yet again and said, “Perhaps there shall be forty found there?” And He said, “I will not do it for forty’s sake.”
30 And he said unto Him, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Perhaps there shall thirty be found there.” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
31 And he said, “Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Perhaps there shall be twenty found there.” And He said, “I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.”
32 And he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Perhaps ten shall be found there.” And He said, “I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.”
33 And the Lord went His way, as soon as He had finished communing with Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place.
Genesis 19 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
19 And there came two angels to Sodom at evening, and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot, seeing them, rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2 and he said, “Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways.” And they said, “Nay, but we will remain in the street all night.”
3 And he pressed upon them greatly, and they turned in unto him and entered into his house; and he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom — both young and old, all the people from every quarter —compassed the house around.
5 And they called unto Lot and said unto him, “Where are the men who came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them.”
6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him
7 and said, “I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
8 Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes. Only unto these men do nothing, for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.”
9 And they said, “Stand back.” And they said again, “This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will become a judge! Now will we deal worse with thee than with them.” And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
10 But the men put forth their hands, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
11 And they smote the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12 And the men said unto Lot, “Hast thou here any besides? Soninlaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city — bring them out of this place.
13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has waxed great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.”
14 And Lot went out and spoke unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, “Up, get ye out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city!” But he seemed as one who mocked unto his sons-in-law.
15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, “Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters who are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”
16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters, the Lord being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth and set him outside the city.
17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth outside, that he said, “Escape for thy life! Look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain. Escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed!”
18 And Lot said unto them, “Oh, not so, my lord.
19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die.
20 Behold now, this city is near enough to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.”
21 And he said unto him, “See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city for which thou hast spoken.
22 Hasten thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
23 The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
24 Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire, from the Lord out of heaven;
25 and He overthrew those cities, and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
27 And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord;
28 and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld. And lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
30 And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt on the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth.
32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.”
33 And they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34 And it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger, “Behold, I lay yesternight with my father. Let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou in and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.”
35 And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
37 And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
38 And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Benammi; the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
Genesis 20 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
20 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar.
2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, “Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.”
4 But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, wilt Thou slay also a righteous nation?
5 Said he not unto me, ‘She is my sister’? And she, even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.”
6 And God said unto him in a dream, “Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart, for I also withheld thee from sinning against Me. Therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.
7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.”
8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were sore afraid.
9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him, “What hast thou done unto us? And how have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.”
10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, “What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?”
11 And Abraham said, “Because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.
12 And yet indeed she is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, ‘This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me: at every place whither we shall come, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
14 And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and menservants and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.
15 And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleaseth thee.”
16 And unto Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all who are with thee and with all other.” Thus she was reproved.
17 So Abraham prayed unto God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife and his maidservants; and they bore children,
18 for the Lord had closed up fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
Genesis 21 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
21 And the Lord visited Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as He had spoken.
2 For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
3 And Abraham called the name of his son who was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
5 And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him.
6 And Sarah said, “God hath made me laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me.”
7 And she said, “Who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”
8 And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.
10 Therefore she said unto Abraham, “Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.”
11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.
12 And God said unto Abraham, “Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman. In all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.”
14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water; and he gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
15 And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
16 And she went and sat down apart from him a good way off, as it were, a bowshot; for she said, “Let me not see the death of the child.” And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.
17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her, “What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
18 Arise; lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand, for I will make him a great nation.”
19 And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
21 And he dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
22 And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the chief captain of his host, spoke unto Abraham, saying, “God is with thee in all that thou doest.
23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.”
24 And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
26 And Abimelech said, “I know not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it until today.”
27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech, and both of them made a covenant.
28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, “What mean these seven ewe lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?”
30 And he said, “These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness unto me that I have dug this well.”
31 Therefore he called that place Beersheba [that is, The well of the oath], because there they swore, both of them.
32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God.
34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
Genesis 22 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
22 And it came to pass after these things, that God tested Abraham and said unto him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Behold, here I am.”
2 And He said, “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.”
3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him.
4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
5 And Abraham said unto his young men, “Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.”
6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and they went both of them together.
7 And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here am I, my son.” And he said, “Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
8 And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering.” So they went both of them together.
9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.”
12 And He said, “Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.”
13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh [that is, The Lord will provide]; as it is said to this day, “In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.”
15 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time
16 and said, “By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,
17 in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.
18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed My voice.”
19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, “Behold Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy brother Nahor:
21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
22 and Chesed and Hazo, and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.”
23 And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah and Gaham, and Thahash and Maachah.
Genesis 23 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
23 And Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba (the same is Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,
4 “I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession for a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
6 “Hear us, my lord: Thou art a mighty prince among us; in the choicest of our sepulchers bury thy dead. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher, that thou mayest bury thy dead.”
7 And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
8 And he communed with them, saying, “If it be in your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,
9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he hath, which is in the end of his field. For as much money as it is worth he shall give it to me as a possession for a burying place amongst you.”
10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
11 “Nay, my lord, hear me: The field give I thee; and the cave that is therein, I give it to thee. In the presence of the sons of my people give I it to thee; bury thy dead.”
12 And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
13 And he spoke unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me. I will give thee money for the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”
14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
15 “My lord, hearken unto me: The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver. What is that between me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead.”
16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed the silver for Ephron which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth: four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about, were secured
18 unto Abraham as a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (the same is Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
20 And the field and the cave that is therein were secured unto Abraham as a possession for a burying place by the sons of Heth.
Genesis 24 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
24 And Abraham was old and well stricken in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.
2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh;
3 and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
4 But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”
5 And the servant said unto him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?”
6 And Abraham said unto him, “Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
7 The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke unto me and who swore unto me, saying, ‘Unto thy seed will I give this land,’ He shall send His angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again.”
9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
10 And the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and departed, for all the goods of his master were in his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
11 And he made his camels to kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
12 And he said, “O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray Thee, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.
13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.
14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, ‘Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink,’ and she shall say, ‘Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also’ — let the same be she whom Thou hast appointed for Thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that Thou hast shown kindness unto my master.”
15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up.
17 And the servant ran to meet her and said, “Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher.”
18 And she said, “Drink, my lord”; and she hastened and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, “I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.”
20 And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
21 And the man, wondering at her, held his peace to learn whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.
22 And it came to pass, as the camels were done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,
23 and said, “Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee, is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?”
24 And she said unto him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nahor.”
25 She said moreover unto him, “We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.”
26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshiped the Lord.
27 And he said, “Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master from His mercy and His truth. I, being on the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master’s brethren.”
28 And the damsel ran and told those of her mother’s house these things.
29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man by the well.
30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring, and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “Thus spoke the man unto me,” that he came unto the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
31 And he said, “Come in, thou blessed of the Lord. Why standest thou outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.”
32 And the man came into the house; and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
33 And there was meat set before him to eat; but he said, “I will not eat until I have told mine errand.” And he said, “Speak on.”
34 And he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.
35 And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become great; and He hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and menservants and maidservants, and camels and asses.
36 And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
37 And my master made me swear, saying, ‘Thou shalt not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;
38 but thou shalt go unto my father’s house and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.’
39 And I said unto my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’
40 And he said unto me, ‘The Lord, before whom I walk, will send His angel with thee and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house.
41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.’
42 And I came this day unto the well and said, ‘O Lord God of my master Abraham, if now Thou do prosper my way which I go,
43 behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, “Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink,”
44 and she say to me, “Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels,” let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master’s son.’
45 And before I was done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well and drew water. And I said unto her, ‘Let me drink, I pray thee.’
46 And she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also’; so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
47 And I asked her and said, ‘Whose daughter art thou?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore unto him’; and I put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands.
48 And I bowed down my head and worshiped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.
49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”
50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The thing proceedeth from the Lord; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee; take her and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the Lord hath spoken.”
52 And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that he worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.
53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah; he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
54 And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and tarried all night; and they arose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away unto my master.”
55 And her brother and her mother said, “Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.”
56 And he said unto them, “Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way. Send me away, that I may go to my master.”
57 And they said, “We will call the damsel, and inquire from her mouth.”
58 And they called Rebekah and said unto her, “Wilt thou go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”
59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant and his men.
60 And they blessed Rebekah and said unto her, “Thou art our sister; be thou the mother of thousands of millions; and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.”
61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels and followed the man; and the servant took Rebekah and went his way.
62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide; and he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, the camels were coming.
64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she alighted from the camel.
65 For she had said unto the servant, “What man is this who walketh in the field to meet us?” And the servant had said, “It is my master”; therefore she took a veil and covered herself.
66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent; and he took Rebekah and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
Genesis 25 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
25 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
2 And she bore him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan, and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.
3 And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.
4 And the sons of Midian: Ephah and Epher, and Hanoch and Abidah and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
6 But unto the sons of the concubines whom Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and while he yet lived he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward unto the east country.
7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,
10 the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.
12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore unto Abraham.
13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam,
14 and Mishma and Dumah and Massa,
15 Hadar and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns and by their castles, twelve princes according to their nations.
17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people.
18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt as thou goest toward Assyria; and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begot Isaac.
20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah for a wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.
21 And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it be so, why am I thus?” And she went to inquire of the Lord.
23 And the Lord said unto her, “Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy body; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger.”
24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
25 And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold of Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them.
27 And the boys grew. And Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
29 And Jacob boiled pottage; and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.
30 And Esau said to Jacob, “Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for I am faint”; therefore was his name called Edom.
31 And Jacob said, “Sell me this day thy birthright.”
32 And Esau said, “Behold, I am at the point of dying. And what profit shall this birthright be to me?”
33 And Jacob said, “Swear to me this day.” And he swore unto him, and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
Genesis 26 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
26 And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
2 And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, “Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee and will bless thee. For unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father.
4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,
5 because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”
6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
7 And the men of the place asked him concerning his wife. And he said, “She is my sister”; for he feared to say, “She is my wife,” lest, said he, “the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she was fair to look upon.”
8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out a window and saw, and behold, Isaac was frolicking with Rebekah his wife.
9 And Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, ‘She is my sister’?” And Isaac said unto him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die for her.’”
10 And Abimelech said, “What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.”
11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, “He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold; and the Lord blessed him.
13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great.
14 For he had possession of flocks and possession of herds, and great store of servants; and the Philistines envied him.
15 For all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth.
16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, “Go from us, for thou art much mightier than we.”
17 And Isaac departed from thence, and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar and dwelt there.
18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
19 And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
20 And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” And he called the name of the well Esek [that is, Contention], because they strove with him.
21 And they dug another well, and strove for that also; and he called the name of it Sitnah [that is, Hatred].
22 And he removed from thence, and dug another well, and for that they strove not; and he called the name of it Rehoboth [that is, Room]. And he said, “For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”
23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
24 And the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said, “I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for My servant Abraham’s sake.”
25 And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.
26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath one of his friends and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
27 And Isaac said unto them, “Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you?”
28 And they said, “We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee; and we said, ‘Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,
29 that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of the Lord.’”
30 And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
31 And they rose up early in the morning and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said unto him, “We have found water.”
33 And he called it Shebah [that is, An oath]; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba [that is, The well of the oath] unto this day.
34 And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
35 who were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Genesis 27 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
27 And it came to pass that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son and said unto him, “My son.” And he said unto him, “Behold, here am I.”
2 And he said, “Behold now, I am old; I know not the day of my death.
3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field and take me some venison.
4 And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, that my soul may bless thee before I die.”
5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
6 And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
7 ‘Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before my death.’
8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats, and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth;
10 and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death.”
11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
12 My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.”
13 And his mother said unto him, “Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, fetch me them.”
14 And he went, and fetched and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.
15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son;
16 and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck.
17 And she gave the savory meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
18 And he came unto his father, and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here am I. Who art thou, my son?”
19 And Jacob said unto his father, “I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.”
20 And Isaac said unto his son, “How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.”
21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, “Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.”
22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.
24 And he said, “Art thou my very son Esau?” And he said, “I am.”
25 And he said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee.” And he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
26 And his father Isaac said unto him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”
27 And he came near, and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him and said, “See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed.
28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine.
29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee. Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee!”
30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
31 And he also had made savory meat, and brought it unto his father and said unto his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.”
32 And Isaac his father said unto him, “Who art thou?” And he said, “I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.”
33 And Isaac trembled exceedingly and said, “Who? Where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? Yea, and he shall be blessed.”
34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!”
35 And he said, “Thy brother came with subtlety, and hath taken away thy blessing.”
36 And he said, “Is not he rightly named Jacob [that is, A supplanter]? For he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright, and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.” And he said, “Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?”
37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, “Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him. And what shall I do now unto thee, my son?”
38 And Esau said unto his father, “Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, “Behold, thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above.
40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.”
41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then will I slay my brother Jacob.”
42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, “Behold, thy brother Esau doth comfort himself concerning thee, purposing to kill thee.
43 Now therefore my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother in Haran,
44 and tarry with him a few days until thy brother’s fury turn away—
45 until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him. Then I will send and fetch thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?”
46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?”
Genesis 28 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
28 And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him and said unto him, “Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
2 Arise, go to Padanaram to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father, and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.
3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
4 and give thee the blessing of Abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee, that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.”
5 And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram to take him a wife from thence, and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, “Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,”
7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padanaram,
8 and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father—
9 then went Esau unto Ishmael, and added unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
11 And he alighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
12 And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
13 And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, “I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac: The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east, and to the north and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
15 And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.”
16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.”
17 And he was afraid and said, “How fearsome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it.
19 And he called the name of that place Bethel [that is, The house of God]; but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on,
21 so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God.
22 And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God’s house; and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give a tenth unto Thee.”
Genesis 29 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
29 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
2 And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks; and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.
3 And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.
4 And Jacob said unto them, “My brethren, from whence be ye?” And they said, “Of Haran are we.”
5 And he said unto them, “Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.”
6 And he said unto them, “Is he well?” And they said, “He is well; and behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.”
7 And he said, “Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.”
8 And they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and until they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.”
9 And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them.
10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth and watered the flock of Laban, his mother’s brother.
11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.
12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father.
13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
14 And Laban said to him, “Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.” And he abode with him the space of a month.
15 And Laban said unto Jacob, “Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?”
16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
17 Leah was tendereyed, but Rachel was beautiful and wellfavored.
18 And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, “I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.”
19 And Laban said, “It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.”
20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
21 And Jacob said unto Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.”
22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.
23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid.
25 And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was Leah; and he said to Laban, “What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou beguiled me?”
26 And Laban said, “It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
27 Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this other also, for which service thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.”
28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife also.
29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
31 And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
32 And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben [that is, See a son]; for she said, “Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction. Now therefore my husband will love me.”
33 And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated, He hath therefore given me this son also.” And she called his name Simeon [that is, Hearing].
34 And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore was his name called Levi [that is, Joined].
35 And she conceived again and bore a son; and she said, “Now will I praise the Lord.” Therefore she called his name Judah [that is, Praise], and ceased bearing.
Genesis 30 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
30 And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said unto Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die.”
2 And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, “Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?”
3 And she said, “Behold my maid Bilhah. Go in unto her, and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.”
4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid for a wife; and Jacob went in unto her.
5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
6 And Rachel said, “God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan [that is, Judging].
7 And Bilhah, Rachel’s maid, conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
8 And Rachel said, “With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed.” And she called his name Naphtali [that is, My wrestling].
9 When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing, she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob for a wife;
10 and Zilpah, Leah’s maid, bore Jacob a son.
11 And Leah said, “A troop cometh.” And she called his name Gad [that is, A troop or company].
12 And Zilpah, Leah’s maid, bore Jacob a second son.
13 And Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed.” And she called his name Asher [that is, Happy].
14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.”
15 But she said unto her, “Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? And wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also?” And Rachel said, “Therefore he shall lie with thee tonight, for thy son’s mandrakes.”
16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, “Thou must come in unto me, for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes.” And he lay with her that night.
17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob the fifth son.
18 And Leah said, “God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband.” And she called his name Issachar [that is, A hire].
19 And Leah conceived again and bore Jacob the sixth son.
20 And Leah said, “God hath endued me with a good dowry. Now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” And she called his name Zebulun [that is, Dwelling].
21 And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah [that is, Judgment].
22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her and opened her womb.
23 And she conceived and bore a son, and said, “God hath taken away my reproach.”
24 And she called his name Joseph [that is, Adding], and said, “The Lord shall add to me another son.”
25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, “Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place and to my country.
26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go; for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.”
27 And Laban said unto him, “I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry; for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.”
28 And he said, “Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.”
29 And he said unto him, “Thou knowest how I have served thee and how thy flocks have been with me.
30 For it was little which thou had before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming. And now, when shall I provide for mine own house also?”
31 And he said, “What shall I give thee?” And Jacob said, “Thou shalt not give me any thing. If thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:
32 I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted animals, and all the brown animals among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and of such shall be my hire.
33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.”
34 And Laban said, “Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.”
35 And he removed that day the hegoats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the shegoats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
36 And he set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
37 And Jacob took rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chestnut tree, and peeled white strips in them and made the white appear which was in the rods.
38 And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth animals ringstreaked, speckled and spotted.
40 And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban’s flocks.
41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger animals conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the animals in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
42 But when the animals were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
43 And the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.
Genesis 31 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
31 And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and from that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.”
2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as before.
3 And the Lord said unto Jacob, “Return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.”
4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
5 and said unto them, “I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God did not suffer him to hurt me.
8 If he said thus: ‘The speckled shall be thy wages,’ then all the animals bore speckled; and if he said thus: ‘The ringstreaked shall be thy hire,’ then all the animals bore ringstreaked.
9 Thus God hath taken away the flocks of your father, and given them to me.
10 And it came to pass at the time that the animals conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the animals were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
11 And the angel of God spoke unto me in a dream, saying, ‘Jacob!’ And I said, ‘Here am I.’
12 And he said, ‘Lift up now thine eyes and see: all the rams which leap upon the animals are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointed the pillar, and where thou vowed a vow unto Me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.’”
14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
15 Are we not counted by him strangers? For he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.”
17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels.
18 And he carried away all his flocks and all his goods which he had gotten, the flocks of his getting which he had gotten in Padanaram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
19 And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father’s.
20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount of Gilead.
22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him on the mount of Gilead.
24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, “Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.”
25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent on the mount; and Laban with his brethren pitched on the mount of Gilead.
26 And Laban said to Jacob, “What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?
27 Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with taboret and with harp,
28 and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying, ‘Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.’
30 And now, though thou wouldest be gone, because thou sorely longed after thy father’s house, yet why hast thou stolen my gods?”
31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid; for I said, ‘Perhaps thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.’
32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live. Before our brethren, discern thou what is thine with me, and take it with thee.” For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
33 And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents, but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s saddle and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
35 And she said to her father, “Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee, for the custom of women is upon me.” And he searched, but found not the images.
36 And Jacob was wroth, and chided Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
37 Whereas thou hast searched all my goods, what hast thou found of all thy household things? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge between us both.
38 These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
39 That which was torn by beasts I brought not unto thee; I bore the loss of it. From my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
40 Thus I was: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house. I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flocks; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
42 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou would have sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.”
43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine. And what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?
44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be a witness between me and thee.”
45 And Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, “Gather stones”; and they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there upon the heap.
47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha [that is, The heap of witness], but Jacob called it Galeed.
48 And Laban said, “This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.” Therefore was the name of it called Galeed,
49 and Mizpah [that is, A beacon or watchtower]; for he said, “The Lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another.
50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters, no man is with us—see, God is witness between me and thee!”
51 And Laban said to Jacob, “Behold this heap and behold this pillar, which I have cast between me and thee.
52 This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass beyond this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they ate bread, and tarried all night on the mount.
55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. And Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
Genesis 32 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
32 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s host.” And he called the name of that place Mahanaim [that is, Two hosts or camps].
3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
4 And he commanded them, saying, “Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau, ‘Thy servant Jacob saith thus: I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now,
5 and I have oxen and asses, flocks and menservants and womenservants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.’”
6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.”
7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands.
8 And he said, “If Esau come to the one company and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.”
9 And Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the Lord who saidst unto me, ‘Return unto thy country and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee’—
10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two bands.
11 Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children.
12 And Thou saidst, ‘I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’”
13 And he lodged there that same night, and took from that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother:
14 two hundred shegoats and twenty hegoats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
15 thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty sheasses and ten foals.
16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.”
17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee, saying, ‘Whose art thou? And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?’
18 then thou shalt say, ‘They are thy servant Jacob’s. It is a present sent unto my lord Esau; and behold also, he is behind us.’”
19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, “In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when ye find him.
20 And say ye moreover, ‘Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.’” For he said, “I will appease him with the presents that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”
21 So went the presents over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the company.
22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
23 And he took them and sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had.
24 And Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
25 And when the man saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him.
26 And the man said, “Let me go, for the day breaketh.” And he said, “I will not let thee go, unless thou bless me.”
27 And he said unto him, “What is thy name?” And he said, “Jacob.”
28 And he said, “Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.”
29 And Jacob asked him, and said, “Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.” And he said, “Why is it that thou dost ask after my name?” And he blessed him there.
30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel [that is, The face of God]: “For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”
31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh.
32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.
Genesis 33 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
33 And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau came and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two handmaids.
2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindmost.
3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.
4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him; and they wept.
5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are those with thee?” And he said, “The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.”
6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
7 And Leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves; and after these came Joseph and Rachel near, and they bowed themselves.
8 And he said, “What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?” And he said, “These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.”
9 And Esau said, “I have enough, my brother. Keep what thou hast unto thyself.”
10 And Jacob said, “Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; for therefore I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee, because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” And he urged him, and he took it.
12 And he said, “Let us take our journey; and let us go, and I will go before thee.”
13 And he said unto him, “My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me; and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant; and I will lead on gently, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children are able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.”
15 And Esau said, “Let me now leave with thee some of the folk who are with me.” And he said, “What need is there? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.”
16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth [that is, Booths].
18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram, and pitched his tent before the city.
19 And he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.
20 And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel [that is, God, the God of Israel].
Genesis 34 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
34 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her and lay with her, and defiled her.
3 And his soul cleaved unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel and spoke kindly unto the damsel.
4 And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this damsel for a wife.”
5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob held his peace until they had come.
6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, which thing ought not to be done.
8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter. I pray you give her to him for a wife;
9 and make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
10 And ye shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.”
11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, “Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me, I will give.
12 Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me; but give me the damsel for a wife.”
13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said — because he had defiled Dinah their sister”
14 and they said unto them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach unto us.
15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised,
16 then will we give our daughters unto you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
17 But if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and we will be gone.”
18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem, Hamor’s son.
19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter; and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.
20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
21 “These men are peaceable with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
22 Only herein will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? Only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.”
24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all who went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males.
26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.
27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and despoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
28 They took their sheep and their oxen and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;
29 and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives took they captive, and despoiled even all that was in the house.
30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “Ye have troubled me to make me a stench among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. And I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.”
31 And they said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?”
Genesis 35 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
35 And God said unto Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.”
2 Then Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him, “Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean and change your garments.
3 And let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.”
4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
5 And they journeyed; and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
6 So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people that were with him.
7 And he built there an altar and called the place Elbethel [that is, The God of Bethel], because there God appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother.
8 But Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under an oak; and the name of it was called Allonbachuth [that is, The oak of weeping].
9 And God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.
10 And God said unto him, “Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called Jacob any more, but Israel shall be thy name”; and He called his name Israel.
11 And God said unto him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.”
13 And God went up from him in the place where He talked with him.
14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, even a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him Bethel.
16 And they journeyed from Bethel. And there was but a little way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, “Fear not. Thou shalt have this son also.”
18 And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died), that she called his name Benoni [that is, The son of my sorrow], but his father called him Benjamin [that is, The son of the right hand].
19 And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.
21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
23 The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon and Levi, and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;
24 the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
25 and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;
26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padanaram.
27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father at Mamre, unto the city of Arbah (which is Hebron) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
28 And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
29 And Isaac gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Genesis 36 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
36 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
3 and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
4 And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel;
5 and Aholibamah bore Jeush and Jaalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together, and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
8 Thus dwelt Esau in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
9 And these are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.
10 These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.
11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son, and she bore to Eliphaz, Amalek: these were the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife.
13 And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife; and she bore to Esau: Jeush and Jaalam and Korah.
15 These were chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau: Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,
16 Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek: these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.
17 And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, Chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, Chief Korah: these were the chiefs who came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.
19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their chiefs.
20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land: Lotan and Shobal, and Zibeon and Anah,
21 and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister was Timna.
23 And the children of Shobal were these: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
24 And these are the children of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah; this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
25 And the children of Anah were these: Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
26 And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban, and Ithran and Cheran.
27 The children of Ezer are these: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.
28 The children of Dishan are these: Uz and Aran.
29 These are the chiefs who came of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,
30 Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, Chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, among their chiefs in the land of Seir.
31 And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.
35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Avith.
36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.
38 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
40 And these are the names of the chiefs who came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,
41 Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,
42 Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar,
43 Chief Magdiel, Chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession; he is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
Genesis 37 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
37 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives. And Joseph brought unto his father an evil report about them.
3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colors.
4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.
5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren; and they hated him yet the more.
6 And he said unto them, “Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.”
8 And his brethren said to him, “Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?” And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.
9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren and said, “Behold, I have dreamed one dream more; and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.”
10 And he told it to his father and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him and said unto him, “What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?”
11 And his brethren envied him, but his father observed the saying.
12 And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
13 And Israel said unto Joseph, “Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them.” And he said to him, “Here am I.”
14 And he said to him, “Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks, and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the Vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
15 And a certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, “What seekest thou?”
16 And he said, “I seek my brethren. Tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.”
17 And the man said, “They have departed hence, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
19 And they said one to another, “Behold, this dreamer cometh.
20 Come now therefore and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, ‘Some evil beast hath devoured him’; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.”
21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands and said, “Let us not kill him.”
22 And Reuben said unto them, “Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him” — that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again.
23 And it came to pass, when Joseph had come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;
24 and they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.
25 And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels, bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry them down to Egypt.
26 And Judah said unto his brethren, “What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh.” And his brethren were content.
28 Then there passed by Midianite merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
29 And Reuben returned unto the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
30 And he returned unto his brethren and said, “The child is no more; and I, whither shall I go?”
31 And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid from the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood.
32 And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father and said, “This have we found. Know now whether it be thy son’s coat or not?”
33 And he knew it, and said, “It is my son’s coat. An evil beast hath devoured him. Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.”
34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, “For I will go down into the grave unto my son, mourning.” Thus his father wept for him.
36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s and captain of the guard.
Genesis 38 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
38 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned unto a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her.
3 And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
4 And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
5 And she yet again conceived and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. And he was at Chezib when she bore him.
6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
7 And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.
8 And Judah said unto Onan, “Go in unto thy brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.”
9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.
10 And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He slew him also.
11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow at thy father’s house, until Shelah my son is grown”; for he said, “Lest perhaps he die also, as his brethren did.” And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.
12 And in process of time, the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
13 And it was told Tamar, saying, “Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
14 And she put her widow’s garments off from her and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him as wife.
15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, because she had covered her face.
16 And he turned unto her on the wayside and said, “Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee” (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law). And she said, “What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?”
17 And he said, “I will send thee a kid from the flock.” And she said, “Wilt thou give me a pledge until thou send it?”
18 And he said, “What pledge shall I give thee?” And she said, “Thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand.” And he gave it to her and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
19 And she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand, but he found her not.
21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, “Where is the harlot who was openly by the wayside?” And they said, “There was no harlot in this place.”
22 And he returned to Judah and said, “I cannot find her, and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place.”
23 And Judah said, “Let her take them for herself, lest we be shamed; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.”
24 And it came to pass about three months after that it was told Judah, saying, “Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom.” And Judah said, “Bring her forth, and let her be burned.”
25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man whose these are, am I with child.” And she said, “Discern, I pray thee, whose are these — the signet, and bracelets, and staff.”
26 And Judah acknowledged them and said, “She hath been more righteous than I, because I gave her not to Shelah my son.” And he knew her again no more.
27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail that, behold, twins were in her womb.
28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, “This came out first.”
29 And it came to pass as he drew back his hand that, behold, his brother came out; and she said, “How hast thou broken forth? This breach be upon thee.” Therefore his name was called Perez [that is, A breach].
30 And afterward came out his brother who had the scarlet thread upon his hand, and his name was called Zerah.
Genesis 39 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
39 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.
2 And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
3 And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him. And he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.
6 And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not anything he had, save the bread which he ate. And Joseph was a goodly person, and wellfavored.
7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”
8 But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, “Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand.
9 There is none greater in this house than I, neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”
10 And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her.
11 And it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business, and there were none of the men of the house there within.
12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and got himself out.
13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled forth,
14 that she called unto the men of her house and spoke unto them, saying, “See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us. He came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
15 And it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me and fled, and got himself out.”
16 And she laid aside his garment by her until his lord came home.
17 And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me.
18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me and fled out.”
19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke unto him, saying, “After this manner did thy servant to me,” that his wrath was kindled.
20 And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were bound; and he was there in the prison.
21 But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
23 The keeper of the prison looked not into any thing that was under his hand, because the Lord was with him; and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.
Genesis 40 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
40 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers—against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers.
3 And he put them under guard in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season under guard.
5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them, and behold, they were sad.
7 And he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in the guard of his lord’s house, saying, “Why look ye so sadly today?”
8 And they said unto him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.” And Joseph said unto them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me them, I pray you.”
9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was before me.
10 And in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth, and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes.
11 And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”
12 And Joseph said unto him, “This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days.
13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place; and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me; and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”
16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head.
17 And in the uppermost basket there were all manner of baked meats for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.”
18 And Joseph answered and said, “This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days.
19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.”
20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;
22 but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgot him.
Genesis 41 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
41 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed; and behold, he stood by the river.
2 And behold, there came up out of the river seven wellfavored cows, and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
3 And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, illfavored and leanfleshed, and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.
4 And the illfavored and leanfleshed cows ate up the seven wellfavored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
5 And he slept and dreamed the second time; and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
6 And behold, seven thin ears, blasted with the east wind sprang up after them.
7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
9 Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, “I do remember my faults this day.
10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me under guard in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker.
11 And we dreamed a dream one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
12 And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he did interpret.
13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.”
14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved himself and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it; and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.”
16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”
17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river.
18 And behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fatfleshed and wellfavored, and they fed in a meadow.
19 And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very illfavored and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.
20 And the lean and the illfavored cows ate up the first seven fat cows;
21 and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them, but they were still illfavored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
22 And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good;
23 and behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind sprang up after them.
24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. And I told this unto the magicians, but there was none that could declare it to me.”
25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one. God hath shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years: the dreams are one.
27 And the seven thin and illfavored cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do He showeth unto Pharaoh.
29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.
30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.
31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following, for it shall be very grievous.
32 And for that the dream was repeated unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
33 Now therefore let Pharaoh seek out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up a fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
36 And that food shall be for store for the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land perish not through the famine.”
37 And the counsel was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, “Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?”
39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, “Inasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art.
40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled. Only in the throne will I be greater than thou.”
41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, “See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.”
42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.
43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, “Bow the knee!” And he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”
45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea — very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.
50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On, bore unto him.
51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh [that is, Forgetting], “For God,” said he, “hath made me forget all my toil and all my father’s house.”
52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim [that is, Fruitful], “For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
53 And the seven years of plenteousness, which were in the land of Egypt, were ended.
54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said; and the dearth was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, “Go unto Joseph. What he saith to you, do.”
56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians. And the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn, because the famine was so sore in all lands.
Genesis 42 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
42 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, “Why do ye look one upon another?”
2 And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. Go down thither and buy for us from thence, that we may live and not die.”
3 And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
4 But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren, for he said, “Lest perhaps mischief befall him.”
5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was who sold to all the people of the land; and Joseph’s brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he recognized them, but made himself as a stranger unto them and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, “From whence come ye?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”
8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said unto them, “Ye are spies! To see the nakedness of the land ye have come!”
10 And they said unto him, “Nay, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come.
11 We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.”
12 And he said unto them, “Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye have come.”
13 And they said, “Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.”
14 And Joseph said unto them, “That is it that I spoke unto you, saying, ‘Ye are spies!’
15 Hereby ye shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, unless your youngest brother come hither.
16 Send one of you and let him fetch your brother; and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be tested, whether there be any truth in you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies!”
17 And he put them all together into custody three days.
18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, “This do, and live, for I fear God:
19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the prison house. Go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses.
20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.” And they did so.
21 And they said one to another, “We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear. Therefore has this distress come upon us.”
22 And Reuben answered them, saying, “Spoke I not unto you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the child’; and ye would not hear? Therefore, behold, also his blood is required.”
23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them, for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.
24 And he turned himself away from them and wept; and returned to them again and communed with them, and took from them Simeon and bound him before their eyes.
25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus did he unto them.
26 And they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence.
27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender at the inn, he espied his money; for behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
28 And he said unto his brethren, “My money is restored; and lo, it is even in my sack.” And their heart failed them and they were afraid, saying one to another, “What is this that God hath done unto us?”
29 And they came unto Jacob their father, unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,
30 “The man who is the lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
31 And we said unto him, ‘We are true men; we are no spies.
32 We are twelve brethren, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’
33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, ‘Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: Leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone;
34 and bring your youngest brother unto me. Then shall I know that ye are not spies, but that ye are true men; so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.’”
35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
36 And Jacob their father said unto them, “Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and ye will take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”
37 And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, “Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee. Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.”
38 And he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If mischief befall him by the way in which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.”
Genesis 43 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
43 And the famine was sore in the land.
2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, “Go again, buy us a little food.”
3 And Judah spoke unto him, saying, “The man did solemnly declare unto us, saying, ‘Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother be with you.’
4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food.
5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said unto us, ‘Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother be with you.’”
6 And Israel said, “Why dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?”
7 And they said, “The man asked us strictly about our state, and about our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father yet alive? Have ye another brother?’ And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we certainly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”
8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and thou, and also our little ones.
9 I will be surety for him; from my hand shalt thou require him. If I bring him not unto thee and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever;
10 for had we not lingered, surely now we would have returned this second time.”
11 And their father Israel said unto them, “If it must be so now, do this: Take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds.
12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand. Perhaps it was an oversight.
13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man;
14 and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved!”
15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, “Bring these men home, and slay a beast and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.”
17 And the man did as Joseph bade, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
18 And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time are we brought in, that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and also our asses.”
19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house
20 and said, “O sir, we came indeed down the first time to buy food.
21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it again in our hand.
22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food. We cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.”
23 And he said, “Peace be to you, fear not; your God and the God of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money.” And he brought Simeon out unto them.
24 And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
25 And they made ready the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves before him to the earth.
27 And he asked them of their welfare and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?”
28 And they answered, “Thy servant our father is in good health; he is yet alive.” And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance.
29 And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your younger brother of whom ye spoke unto me?” And he said, “God be gracious unto thee, my son.”
30 And Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned for his brother, and he sought somewhere to weep; and he entered into his chamber and wept there.
31 And he washed his face and went out, and restrained himself, and said, “Set on the bread.”
32 And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marveled one at another.
34 And he took and sent portions unto them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.
Genesis 44 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
44 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in the mouth of his sack.
2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.” And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
4 And when they had gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, “Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, ‘Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
5 Is not this that from which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? Ye have done evil in so doing.’”
6 And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words.
7 And they said unto him, “Why saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing!
8 Behold, the money which we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan. How then would we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.”
10 And he said, “Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant, and ye shall be blameless.”
11 Then every man speedily took down his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
12 And he searched, and began with the eldest and ended with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
13 Then they rent their clothes; and every man loaded his ass, and returned to the city.
14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house (for he was yet there), and they fell before him on the ground.
15 And Joseph said unto them, “What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?”
16 And Judah said, “What shall we say unto my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.”
17 And he said, “God forbid that I should do so; but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go up in peace unto your father.”
18 Then Judah came near unto him and said, “Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have ye a father or a brother?’
20 And we said unto my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.’
21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, ‘Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.’
22 And we said unto my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’
23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.’
24 And it came to pass, when we came up unto thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.
25 And our father said, ‘Go again, and buy us a little food.’
26 And we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down, for we may not see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’
27 And thy servant, my father, said unto us, ‘Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;
28 and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces”; and I saw him not since.
29 And if ye take this also from me, and harm befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.’
30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us, seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life,
31 it shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, ‘If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.’
33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant remain instead of the lad as a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren.
34 For how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come upon my father?”
Genesis 45 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
45 Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried, “Cause every man to go out from me!” And there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
2 And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, “I am Joseph. Doth my father yet live?” And his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence.
4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, “Come near to me, I pray you.” And they came near; and he said, “I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
5 Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land, and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be planting nor harvest.
7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God; and He hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
9 Hasten ye, and go up to my father and say unto him, ‘Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of all Egypt. Come down unto me, tarry not;
10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me — thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast.
11 And there will I nourish thee (for yet there are five years of famine), lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty.’
12 And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall make haste and bring down my father hither.”
14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that his brethren talked with him.
16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brethren have come”; and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, “Say unto thy brethren, ‘This do ye: Load your beasts and go, get you unto the land of Canaan.
18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.’
19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye: ‘Take with you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
20 Also, regard not your possessions, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”
21 And the children of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
23 And to his father he sent in this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten sheasses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father on the way.
24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed; and he said unto them, “See that ye fall not out on the way.”
25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
26 and told him, saying, “Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.” And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not.
27 And they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
28 And Israel said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive! I will go and see him before I die.”
Genesis 46 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
46 And Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
2 And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here am I.”
3 And He said, “I am God, the God of thy father. Fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation.
4 I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.”
5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
6 And they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
7 his sons and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters; and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
8 And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu, and Hezron and Carmi.
10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
12 And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan, and Shelah and Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah and Job, and Shimron.
14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel.
15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
17 And the sons of Asher: Jimnah and Ishuah, and Isui and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bore unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
19 The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On, bore unto him.
21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.
22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen.
23 And the son of Dan: Hushim.
24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni, and Jezer and Shillem.
25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bore these unto Jacob; all the souls were seven.
26 All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore and six.
27 And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph to direct his face unto Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.
29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
30 And Israel said unto Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.”
31 And Joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father’s house, “I will go up and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, ‘My brethren and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come unto me.
32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks and their herds, and all that they have.’
33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you and shall say, ‘What is your occupation?’
34 that ye shall say, ‘Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we and also our fathers,’ that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.”
Genesis 47 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
47 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brethren, and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.”
2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, “What is your occupation?” And they said unto Pharaoh, “Thy servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.”
4 They said moreover unto Pharaoh, “To sojourn in the land have we come, for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”
5 And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, “Thy father and thy brethren have come unto thee.
6 The land of Egypt is before thee. In the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any industrious men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.”
7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, “How old art thou?”
9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”
10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
12 And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his father’s household with bread, according to their families.
13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the corn which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said, “Give us bread; for why should we die in thy presence? For the money faileth.”
16 And Joseph said, “Give your cattle; and I will give to you for your cattle, if money fail.”
17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses; and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, “We will not hide it from my lord that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle. There is not anything left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands.
19 Why shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land be not desolate.”
20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them; so the land became Pharaoh’s.
21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they sold not their lands.
23 Then Joseph said unto the people, “Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
24 And it shall come to pass in the harvest, that ye shall give a fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food, and for those of your households and for food for your little ones.”
25 And they said, “Thou hast saved our lives. Let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have a fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh’s.
27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew and multiplied exceedingly.
28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years.
29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph and said unto him, “If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.
30 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.” And he said, “I will do as thou hast said.”
31 And he said, “Swear unto me.” And he swore unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.
Genesis 48 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
48 And it came to pass after these things that one told Joseph, “Behold, thy father is sick”; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
2 And one told Jacob and said, “Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee”; and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.
3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, “God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me
4 and said unto me, ‘Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee; and I will make of thee a multitude of people, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.’
5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
6 And thy issue whom thou begettest after them shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath” (the same is Bethlehem).
8 And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”
9 And Joseph said unto his father, “They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place.” And he said, “Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.”
10 (Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see.) And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them and embraced them.
11 And Israel said unto Joseph, “I had not thought to see thy face; and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.”
12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him.
14 And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
15 And he blessed Joseph and said, “God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who fed me all my life long unto this day,
16 the Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”
17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he held up his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
18 And Joseph said unto his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put thy right hand upon his head.”
19 And his father refused and said, “I know it, my son, I know it. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.”
20 And he blessed them that day, saying, “In thee shall Israel bless, saying, ‘God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.’” And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
21 And Israel said unto Joseph, “Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”
Genesis 49 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
49 And Jacob called unto his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
2 “Gather yourselves together and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and hearken unto Israel your father:
3 “Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.
4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou it; he went up to my couch.
5 “Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they dug down a wall.
7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel! I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
8 “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.
9 Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up. He stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
10 The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come; and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.
11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine, he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes.
12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
13 “Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships, and his border shall be unto Sidon.
14 “Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens.
15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant, and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.
16 “Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse’s heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
18 I have waited for Thy salvation, O Lord!
19 “Gad, a troop shall overcome him; but he shall overcome at the last.
20 “Out of Asher, his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
21 “Naphtali is a hind let loose; he giveth goodly words.
22 “Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall.
23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him.
24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob, from thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel,
25 even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
27 “Benjamin shall raven as a wolf; in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.”
28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is it that their father spoke unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
29 And he charged them and said unto them, “I am to be gathered unto my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession as a burying place.
31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah.
32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.”
33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
Genesis 50 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
50 And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
3 And forty days were fulfilled for him (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed), and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
5 ‘My father made me swear, saying, “Lo, I die; in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.” Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.’”
6 And Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.”
7 And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
8 and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, and their flocks and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company.
10 And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians.” Therefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim [that is, The mourning of the Egyptians], which is beyond the Jordan.
12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them.
13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession as a burying place from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren and all who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
15 And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, “Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.”
16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, “Thy father did command before he died, saying,
17 ‘So shall ye say unto Joseph, “Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren and their sin, for they did unto thee evil.”’ And now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him.
18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face, and they said, “Behold, we are thy servants.”
19 And Joseph said unto them, “Fear not; for am I in the place of God?
20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day, to save many people alive.
21 Now therefore fear ye not; I will nourish you and your little ones.” And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.
22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.
24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, “I die; and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
25 And Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.”
26 So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old. And they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
Exodus 1 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob:
2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah,
3 Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin,
4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
5 And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, for Joseph was in Egypt already.
6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
7 And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
9 And he said unto his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.
10 Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and it come to pass, when there befalleth any war, that they join also unto our enemies and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.”
11 Therefore they set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew; and they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.
14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field; all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor.
15 And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.
16 And he said, “When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the birthstools, if it be a son then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter then she shall live.”
17 But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them, “Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?”
19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.”
20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty.
21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses.
22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, “Every son who is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.”
Exodus 2 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
2 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took for a wife a daughter of Levi.
2 And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
3 And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the reeds by the river’s brink.
4 And his sister stood afar off to learn what would be done to him.
5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and her maidens walked along by the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to fetch it.
6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”
7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?”
8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” And the maid went and called the child’s mother.
9 And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, “Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.” And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses [that is, Drawn out], and she said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”
11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens; and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together; and he said to him that did the wrong, “Why smitest thou thy fellow?”
14 And he said, “Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest thou to kill me as thou killed the Egyptian?” And Moses feared and said, “Surely this thing is known.”
15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.
16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
17 And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, “How is it that ye have come so soon today?”
19 And they said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock.”
20 And he said unto his daughters, “And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”
21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
22 And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom [that is, A stranger there]; for he said, “I have been a stranger in a strange land.”
23 And it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took heed of them.
Exodus 3 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
3 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
2 And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
3 And Moses said, “I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.”
4 And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses.” And he said, “Here am I.”
5 And He said, “Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.”
6 Moreover He said, “I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.
7 And the Lord said, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
8 And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites.
9 Now therefore behold, the cry of the children of Israel hath come unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”
11 And Moses said unto God, “Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?”
12 And He said, “Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.”
13 And Moses said unto God, “Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them, ‘The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you,’ and they shall say to me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I say unto them?”
14 And God said unto Moses, “I Am That I Am.” And He said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, ‘I Am hath sent me unto you.’”
15 And God said moreover unto Moses, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: ‘The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you.’ This is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations.
16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, ‘The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob appeared unto me, saying, “I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;
17 and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.”’
18 And they shall hearken to thy voice; and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, ‘The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.’
19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
20 And I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go.
21 And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall come to pass that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty,
22 but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment; and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters, and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.”
Exodus 4 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
4 And Moses answered and said, “But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, ‘The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.’”
2 And the Lord said unto him, “What is that in thine hand?” And he said, “A rod.”
3 And He said, “Cast it on the ground.” And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
4 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail.” And he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand—
5 “that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee.”
6 And the Lord said furthermore unto him, “Put now thine hand into thy bosom.” And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
7 And He said, “Put thine hand into thy bosom again.” And he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
8 “And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.”
10 And Moses said unto the Lord, “O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant; but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.”
11 And the Lord said unto him, “Who hath made man’s mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or deaf, or the seeing or the blind? Have notI, the Lord?
12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say.”
13 And he said, “O my Lord, send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send.”
14 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and He said, “Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
15 And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.”
18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, “Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt and see whether they are yet alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”
19 And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.”
20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
21 And the Lord said unto Moses, “When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thine hand; but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, ‘Thus saith the Lord: Israel is My son, even My firstborn.
23 And I say unto thee, “Let My son go, that he may serve Me.” And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.’”
24 And it came to pass, on the way at the inn, that the Lord met him and sought to kill him.
25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet and said, “Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.”
26 So He let him go; then she said, “A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.”
27 And the Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” And he went and met him on the mount of God, and kissed him.
28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him.
29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
30 And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
31 And the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that He had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.
Exodus 5 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
5 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, “Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: ‘Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.’”
2 And Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.”
3 And they said, “The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the Lord our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.”
4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, “Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, delay the people from their work? Get you unto your burdens!”
5 And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens!”
6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,
7 “Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
8 And the tally of bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish any thereof. For they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein, and let them not regard vain words.”
10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “Thus saith Pharaoh: ‘I will not give you straw.
11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it; yet not any of your work shall be diminished.’”
12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
13 And the taskmasters hastened them, saying, “Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.”
14 And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were demanded, “Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as heretofore?”
15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, “Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?
16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, ‘Make brick!’ And behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.”
17 But he said, “Ye are idle, ye are idle! Therefore ye say, ‘Let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord.’
18 Go therefore now and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tally of bricks.”
19 And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil straits after it was said, “Ye shall not diminish any from your bricks of your daily task.”
20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way as they came forth from Pharaoh.
21 And they said unto them, “The Lord look upon you and judge, because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.”
22 And Moses returned unto the Lord and said, “Lord, why hast Thou so evilly treated this people? Why is it that Thou hast sent me?
23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all.”
Exodus 6 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
6 Then the Lord said unto Moses, “Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.”
2 And God spoke unto Moses and said unto him, “I am the Lord.
3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty, but by My name Jehovah was I not known to them.
4 And I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.
5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant.
6 Therefore say unto the children of Israel: ‘I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
7 And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the Lord.’”
9 And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel, but they hearkened not unto Moses from anguish of spirit and from cruel bondage.
10 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
11 “Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.”
12 And Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me. How then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?”
13 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
14 These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.
15 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin, and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.
16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years.
17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimi, according to their families.
18 And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar, and Hebron and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years.
19 And the sons of Merari: Mahali and Mushi; these are the families of Levi according to their generations.
20 And Amram took Jochebed, his father’s sister, for a wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years.
21 And the sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.
22 And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Zithri.
23 And Aaron took Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, for a wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
24 And the sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
25 And Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took one of the daughters of Putiel for a wife; and she bore him Phinehas; these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
26 These are that Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, “Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.”
27 These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron.
28 And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt,
29 that the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, “I am the Lord. Speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.”
30 And Moses said before the Lord, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?”
Exodus 7 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
7 And the Lord said unto Moses, “See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
3 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.
4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay My hand upon Egypt and bring forth Mine armies and My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth Mine hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.”
6 And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them; so did they.
7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old when they spoke unto Pharaoh.
8 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
9 “When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, ‘Show a miracle for yourselves,’ then thou shalt say unto Aaron, ‘Take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.’”
10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the Lord had commanded; and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers. Now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.
13 And He hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had said.
14 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hardened; he refuseth to let the people go.
15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning. Lo, he goeth out unto the water, and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink until he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.
16 And thou shalt say unto him, ‘The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness”; and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
17 Thus saith the Lord: “In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: Behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
18 And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.”’”
19 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, “Say unto Aaron, ‘Take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”
20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
21 And the fish that were in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them, as the Lord had said.
23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.
24 And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river.
25 And seven days were fulfilled after the Lord had smitten the river.
Exodus 8 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
8 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, “Go unto Pharaoh and say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.
3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people, and into thine ovens and into thy kneading troughs.
4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants.’”
5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, “Say unto Aaron, ‘Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.’”
6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Entreat the Lord, that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord.”
9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, “Glory over me: When shall I entreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?”
10 And he said, “Tomorrow.” And Moses said, “Be it according to thy word, that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God.
11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people. They shall remain in the river only.”
12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh.
13 And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
14 And they gathered them together upon heaps, and the land stank.
15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had said.
16 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Say unto Aaron, ‘Stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.’”
17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice on man and on beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
18 And the magicians so did with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not; so there were lice upon man and upon beast.
19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had said.
20 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Lo, he cometh forth to the water, and say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
21 Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.
23 And I will put a division between My people and thy people. Tomorrow shall this sign be.’”
24 And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses and into all the land of Egypt. The land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.
25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, “Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.”
26 And Moses said, “It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
27 We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as He shall command us.”
28 And Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away. Entreat for me.”
29 And Moses said, “Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people tomorrow; but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.”
30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
31 And the Lord did according to the word of Moses, and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
Exodus 9 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
9 Then the Lord said unto Moses, “Go in unto Pharaoh and tell him, ‘Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
2 For if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still,
3 behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep. There shall be a very grievous pestilence.
4 And the Lord shall distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belong to the children of Israel.’”
5 And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, “Tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land.”
6 And the Lord did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died, but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
7 And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
8 And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, “Take to you handfuls of ashes from the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains, upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of Egypt.”
10 And they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became boils breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.
11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
12 And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.
13 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh and say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
14 For I will at this time send all My plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants and upon thy people, that thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth.
15 For now I will stretch out My hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
16 And in very deed, for this cause have I raised thee up: to show in thee My power, and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth.
17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against My people, that thou wilt not let them go?
18 Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field, for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home, the hail shallcome down upon them, and they shall die.’”
20 He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses,
21 and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field.
22 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.”
23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
24 So there was hail and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field.
26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
27 And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, “I have sinned this time. The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
28 Entreat the Lord (for it is enough), that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.”
29 And Moses said unto him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail, that thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord’S.
30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God.”
31 And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bolls.
32 But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.
33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord; and the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the Lord had spoken by Moses.
Exodus 10 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
10 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I might show these My signs before him;
2 and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son’s son what things I have wrought in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that ye may know that I am the Lord.”
3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh and said unto him, “Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: ‘How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
4 Else, if thou refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring the locusts into thy border.
5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one shall not be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field.
6 And they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the Egyptians — which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.’” And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
7 And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, “How long shall this man be a snare unto us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God. Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?”
8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, “Go, serve the Lord your God. But who are they that shall go?”
9 And Moses said, “We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go, for we must hold a feast unto the Lord.”
10 And he said unto them, “Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones. Look to it, for evil is before you.
11 Not so! Go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord, for that ye did desire.” And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
12 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.”
13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. Very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of Egypt.
16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, “I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.
17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only.”
18 And he went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
19 And the Lord turned a mighty, strong west wind, which took away the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.
20 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
21 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.”
22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses and said, “Go ye, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed. Let your little ones also go with you.”
25 And Moses said, “Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.
26 Our cattle also shall go with us. There shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God, and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come thither.”
27 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
28 And Pharaoh said unto him, “Get thee from me! Take heed to thyself! See my face no more, for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die!”
29 And Moses said, “Thou hast spoken well. I will see thy face again no more.”
Exodus 11 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
11 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterwards he will let you go hence. When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow from his neighbor, and every woman from her neighbor, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.”
3 And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people.
4 And Moses said, “Thus saith the Lord: ‘About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt;
5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant who is behind the mill, and all the firstborn of beasts.
6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast, that ye may know how the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.’
8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bowdown themselves unto me, saying, ‘Get thee out, and all the people who follow thee!’ And after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
9 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”
10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus 12 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
12 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
2 “This month shall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month they shall take for themselves every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house.
4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats.
6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it.
8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
9 Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire — his head with his legs and with the viscera thereof.
10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
11 And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste; it is the Lord’S Passover.
12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord.
13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt.
14 “‘And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread. Even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
16 And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you. No manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
17 And ye shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.
19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger or born in the land.
20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.’”
21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them, “Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the Passover.
22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out from the door of his house until the morning.
23 For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
24 And ye shall observe this thing as an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
25 And it shall come to pass, when ye come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, ‘What mean ye by this service?’
27 that ye shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the Lord’S Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.’” And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.
28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.
29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.
30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said, “Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel! And go, serve the Lord, as ye have said.
32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said; and be gone, and bless me also.”
33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, “We are all dead men.”
34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses, and they borrowed from the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment.
36 And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they despoiled the Egyptians.
37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.
38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them, and flocks and herds, even very much cattle.
39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even on the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.
42 It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of the Lord to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.
43 And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof;
44 but every man’s servant who is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
45 A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.
46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house, neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land, for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
49 One law shall be for him that is homeborn and for the stranger who sojourneth among you.”
50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
51 And it came to pass the selfsame day that the Lord brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
Exodus 13 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
13 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast; it is Mine.”
3 And Moses said unto the people, “Remember this day in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place. There shall no leavened bread be eaten.
4 This day came ye out, in the month Abib.
5 “And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord.
7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
8 And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, ‘This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.’
9 And it shall be as a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord’S law may be in thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.
10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
11 “And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,
12 that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the womb, and every firstling that cometh from a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the Lord’S.
13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck; and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that thou shalt say unto him, ‘By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.
15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.’
16 And it shall be as a token upon thine hand, and as frontlets between thine eyes; for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt.”
17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.”
18 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up by five in a rank out of the land of Egypt.
19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.”
20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
21 And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, to go by day and night.
22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people.
Exodus 14 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
14 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baalzephon; before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.’
4 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored above Pharaoh, and above all his host, that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord.” And they did so.
5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, “Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”
6 And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him,
7 and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them.
8 And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.
10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid; and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.
11 And they said unto Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?
12 Is not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.”
13 And Moses said unto the people, “Fear ye not. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will show to you today; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
14 The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.”
15 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Why criest thou unto Me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.
16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them; and I will get Myself honor above Pharaoh and above all his host, above his chariots and above his horsemen.
18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten Myself honor above Pharaoh, above his chariots, and above his horsemen.”
19 And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them.
20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these, so that the one came not near the other all the night.
21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.
23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
24 And it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians.
25 And He took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily, so that the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.”
26 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.”
27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared. And the Egyptians fled against it, and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. There remained not so much as one of them.
29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.
30 Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.
31 And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians; and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and His servant Moses.
Exodus 15 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
15 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spoke, saying, “I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.
2 The Lord is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation; He is my God, and I will prepare Him a habitation; my father’s God, and I will exalt Him.
3 The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is His name.
4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea; his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.
5 The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom as a stone.
6 Thy right hand, O Lord, has become glorious in power; Thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
7 And in the greatness of Thine excellency Thou hast overthrown them that rose up against Thee; Thou sentest forth Thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
8 And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
9 The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them. I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.’
10 Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
11 “Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like Thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
12 Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand; the earth swallowed them.
13 Thou in Thy mercy hast led forth the people whom Thou hast redeemed; Thou hast guided them in Thy strength unto Thy holy habitation.
14 “The people shall hear and be afraid; sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
15 Then the chiefs of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them. By the greatness of Thine arm they shall be as still as a stone, till Thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, whom Thou hast purchased.
17 Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in, in the sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established.
18 The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.”
19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.
20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
21 And Miriam answered them: “Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea!”
22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah [that is, Bitterness].
24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”
25 And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He put them to the proof,
26 and said, “If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord that healeth thee.”
27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
Exodus 16 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
16 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
3 And the children of Israel said unto them, “Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and when we ate bread to the full! For ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”
4 Then said the Lord unto Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may put them to the proof, whether they will walk in My law, or no.
5 And it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”
6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, “At evening, then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;
7 and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord, for He heareth your murmurings against the Lord. And what are we, that ye murmur against us?”
8 And Moses said, “This shall be when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full, for the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.”
9 And Moses spoke unto Aaron, “Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come near before the Lord, for He hath heard your murmurings.’”
10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.
11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
12 “I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak unto them, saying, ‘At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.’”
13 And it came to pass that at evening the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
14 And when the dew that lay had gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoarfrost on the ground.
15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, “What is this?” For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, “This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.
16 This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded: ‘Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons. Take ye every man for those who are in his tents.’”
17 And the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less.
18 And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
19 And Moses said, “Let no man leave any of it until the morning.”
20 Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left part of it until the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was wroth with them.
21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
22 And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
23 And he said unto them, “This is that which the Lord hath said: ‘Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord. Bake that which ye will bake today, and boil what ye will boil; and that which remaineth over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’”
24 And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
25 And Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath unto the Lord. Today ye shall not find it in the field.
26 Six days ye shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.”
27 And it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.
28 And the Lord said unto Moses, “How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?
29 See, for the Lord hath given you the Sabbath; therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days. Abide ye every man in his place. Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.”
30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof manna; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
32 And Moses said, “This is the thing which the Lord commandeth: ‘Fill an omer with it to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.’”
33 And Moses said unto Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your generations.”
34 As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the testimony, to be kept.
35 And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited. They ate manna until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
36 Now an omer is a tenth part of an ephah.
Exodus 17 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
17 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of Sin after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord, and pitched camp in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people to drink.
2 Therefore the people chided Moses and said, “Give us water that we may drink.” And Moses said unto them, “Why chide ye me? Why do ye tempt the Lord?”
3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses and said, “Why is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?”
4 And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, “What shall I do unto this people? They are almost ready to stone me!”
5 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod with which thou smotest the river, take in thine hand and go.
6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
7 And he called the name of the place Massah [that is, Temptation], and Meribah [that is, Chiding], because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, “Is the Lord among us or not?”
8 Then came Amalek and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
9 And Moses said unto Joshua, “Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.”
10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
12 But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat thereon. And Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
14 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and recount it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.”
15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi [that is, The Lord my banner];
16 for he said, “Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”
Exodus 18 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
18 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt,
2 then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after Moses had sent her back
3 and her two sons (of whom the name of the one was Gershom [that is, A stranger there], for he said, “I have been an alien in a strange land”;
4 and the name of the other was Eliezer [that is, My God is a help], “For the God of my father,” said he, “was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”);
5 and Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God.
6 And he said unto Moses, “I, thy father-in-law Jethro, have come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her.”
7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.
8 And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them.
9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
10 And Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
11 Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods; for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, He was above them.”
12 And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
13 And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
14 And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What is this thing that thou doest for the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto evening?”
15 And Moses said unto his father-in-law, “Because the people come unto me to inquire of God.
16 When they have a matter, they come unto me, and I judge between one and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and His laws.”
17 And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, “The thing that thou doest is not good.
18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou and this people who are with thee. For this thing is too heavy for thee. Thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
19 Hearken now unto my voice! I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to Godward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God.
20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do.
21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God — men of truth, hating covetousness — and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties and rulers of tens.
22 And let them judge the people at all seasons; and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge. So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
23 If thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.”
24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
26 And they judged the people at all seasons. The hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
27 And Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.
Exodus 19 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
19 In the third month after the children of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the Wilderness of Sinai.
2 For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the desert of Sinai and had pitched camp in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.
3 And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, “Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
4 ‘Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you unto Myself.
5 Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine.
6 And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.”
7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him.
8 And all the people answered together and said, “All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.” And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord.
9 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.” And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.
10 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes
11 and be ready against the third day; for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai.
12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it. Whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death.
13 There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live.’ When the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.”
14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
15 And he said unto the people, “Be ready against the third day. Come not at your wives.”
16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.
17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
18 And Mount Sinai was altogether in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
20 And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mount; and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.
21 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go down. Charge the people, lest they break through to gaze unto the Lord, and many of them perish.
22 And let the priests also, who come near to the Lord, sanctify themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.”
23 And Moses said unto the Lord, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for Thou charged us, saying, ‘Set bounds about the mount and sanctify it.’”
24 And the Lord said unto him, “Away! Get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord, lest He break forth upon them.”
25 So Moses went down unto the people and spoke unto them.
Exodus 20 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
20 And God spoke all these words, saying:
2 “I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
3 “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.
4 “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me,
6 and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments.
7 “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.
8 “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
9 Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work;
10 but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.
11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
12 “Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
13 “Thou shalt not kill.
14 “Thou shalt not commit adultery.
15 “Thou shalt not steal.
16 “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
17 “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.”
18 And all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they removed and stood afar off.
19 And they said unto Moses, “Speak thou with us and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.”
20 And Moses said unto the people, “Fear not; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.”
21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
22 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel: ‘Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
23 Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen. In all places where I record My name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
25 And if thou wilt make Me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.’
Exodus 21 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
21 “Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them:
2 If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was married, then his wife shall go out with him.
4 If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
5 And if the servant shall plainly say, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’
6 then his master shall bring him unto the judges. He shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever.
7 “And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.
8 If she please not her master who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed. To sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
9 And if he has betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
10 If he take for himself another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.
11 And if he does not do these three unto her, then shall she go out free, without money.
12 “He that smiteth a man so that he die shall be surely put to death.
13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand, then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor to slay him with guile, thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die.
15 “And he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.
16 “And he that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
17 “And he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
18 “And if men strive together and one smite another with a stone or with his fist, and he die not but keepeth to his bed,
19 if he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be acquitted; he shall only pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
20 “And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall be surely punished.
21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money.
22 “If men strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no misfortune follow, he shall be surely punished according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
23 And if any misfortune follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
25 burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
26 “And if a man smite the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid, that it perish, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.
27 And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth or his maidservant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.
28 “If an ox gore a man or a woman, so that they die, then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be acquitted.
29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in times past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in so that he hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and his owner also shall be put to death.
30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
31 Whether he hath gored a son or hath gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
33 “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,
34 the owner of the pit shall make it good and give money unto the owner of them, and the dead beast shall be his.
35 And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that he die, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money from it, and the dead ox also they shall divide.
36 Or if it be known that the ox used to push in times past and his owner hath not kept him in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own.
Exodus 22 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
22 “If a man shall steal an ox or a sheep, and kill it or sell it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.
2 “If a thief be found breaking in and be smitten so that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.
3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him, for he should make full restitution. If he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox or ass or sheep, he shall restore double.
5 “If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast and shall feed in another man’s field, of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution.
6 “If fire break out and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn or the standing corn or the field be consumed therewith, he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
7 “If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief be found, let him pay double.
8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges to see whether he has put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods.
9 “For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbor.
10 “If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast to keep, and it die or be hurt or driven away, no man seeing it,
11 then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.
12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.
14 “And if a man borrow aught from his neighbor, and it become hurt or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.
15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a hired thing, it came for his hire.
16 “And if a man entice a maid who is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.
17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
18 “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
19 “Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
20 “He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.
21 “Thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
22 Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.
23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry;
24 and My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
25 “If thou lend money to any of My people who are poor among thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
26 If thou at all take thy neighbor’s raiment in pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by the time the sun goeth down,
27 for that is his only covering. It is his raiment for his skin. Wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear, for I am gracious.
28 “Thou shalt not revile the judges, nor curse the ruler of thy people.
29 “Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors. The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me.

31 “And ye shall be holy men unto Me; neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field: ye shall cast it to the dogs.
Exodus 23 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
23 “Thou shalt not raise a false report. Put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
2 Thou shalt not follow the multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause, following many, to divert judgment.
3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
4 “If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.
6 “Thou shalt not divert the judgment from thy poor in his cause.
7 Keep thee far from a false matter, and the innocent and righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked.
8 And thou shalt take no bribe, for the bribe blindeth the wise and perverteth the words of the righteous.
9 “Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
10 “And six years thou shalt sow thy land and shalt gather in the fruits thereof,
11 but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still, that the poor of thy people may eat; and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and with thy olive trees.
12 “Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest, that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid and the stranger may be refreshed.
13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect; and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
14 “Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year.
15 Thou shalt keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month of Abib, for in it thou camest out from Egypt; and none shall appear before Me empty),
16 and the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of thy labors which thou hast sown in the field, and the Feast of Ingathering, which is at the end of the year when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field.
17 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord God.
18 “Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of My sacrifice remain until the morning.
19 “The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God. “Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother’s milk.
20 “Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
21 Have regard for him, and obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for My name is in him.
22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
23 For Mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites and the Hittites, and the Perizzites and the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.
24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images.
25 And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and He shall bless thy bread and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
26 None shall cast their young nor be barren in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfill.
27 “I will send My fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
28 And I will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.
29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
30 Little by little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased and inherit the land.
31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against Me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.”
Exodus 24 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
24 And He said unto Moses, “Come up unto the Lord, thou and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship ye afar off.
2 And Moses alone shall come near the Lord; but they shall not come nigh, neither shall the people go up with him.”
3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the judgments; and all the people answered with one voice and said, “All the words which the Lord hath said will we do.”
4 And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord.
6 And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
7 And he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the audience of the people; and they said, “All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.”
8 And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words.”
9 Then went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
10 and they saw the God of Israel. And there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.
11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not His hand. Also they saw God, and ate and drank.
12 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Come up to Me onto the mount, and be there; and I will give thee tablets of stone, and a law and commandments which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.”
13 And Moses rose up with his minister Joshua, and Moses went up onto the mount of God.
14 And he said unto the elders, “Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you; and behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. If any man have any matters to arbitrate, let him come unto them.”
15 And Moses went up onto the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
16 And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
17 And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.
18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and got himself up onto the mount; and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights.
Exodus 25 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
25 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring Me an offering. From every man who giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take My offering.
3 And this is the offering which ye shall take from them: gold and silver and brass;
4 and blue and purple and scarlet, and fine linen and goats’ hair;
5 and rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood;
6 oil for the light, spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense;
7 onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate.

12 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
13 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood and overlay them with gold.
14 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

20 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another. Toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.
21 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the Testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.
23 “Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

27 Over against the border shall the rings be for places for the staves to bear the table.

32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side.
33 Three bowls made like unto almonds with a bud and a flower on one branch, and three bowls made like almonds on the other branch with a bud and a flower — so for the six branches that come out of the candlestick.
34 And on the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their buds and their flowers.
35 And there shall be a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.
36 Their buds and their branches shall be of the same. All of it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.
37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof; and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over the face of it.
38 And the tongs thereof and the snuff dishes thereof shall be of pure gold;
39 of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.
40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shown thee on the mount.

22 “Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder (for it is a ram of consecration),
23 and one loaf of bread and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord.
24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.
25 And thou shalt receive them from their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor before the Lord. It is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
26 “And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be thy part.
27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron and of that which is for his sons.
28 And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’ by a statute for ever from the children of Israel, for it is a heave offering; and it shall be a heave offering from the children of Israel from the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the Lord.
29 “And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons’ after him, to be anointed therein and to be consecrated in them.
30 And that son who is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.
31 “And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration and boil his flesh in the holy place.
32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
33 And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.
34 And if aught of the flesh of the consecrations or of the bread remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
35 “And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee. Seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement; and thou shalt cleanse the altar when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it to sanctify it.
37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy. Whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
38 “Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.
39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning, and the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening.
40 And with the one lamb a tenth part of flour mingled with a fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
42 “This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord, where I will meet you to speak there unto thee.
43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory.
44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar. I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to Me in the priest’s office.
45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God.
46 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I am the Lord their God.
Exodus 30 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
30 “And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon; of shittim wood shalt thou make it.
2 A cubit shall be the length thereof and a cubit the breadth thereof. Foursquare shall it be, and two cubits shall be the height thereof. The horns thereof shall be part of the same.
3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.
4 And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof; upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it.
5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood and overlay them with gold.
6 And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with thee.
7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning. When he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.
8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at evening, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations.
9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.
10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements. Once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations. It is most holy unto the Lord.”
11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
12 “When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord when thou numberest them, that there be no plague among them when thou numberest them.
13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel is twenty gerahs); a half shekel shall be the offering to the Lord.
14 Every one who passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the Lord.
15 The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the Lord to make an atonement for your souls.
16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls.”
17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
18 “Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, with his foot also of brass, for washing; and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat.
20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not. Or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the Lord,
21 so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not. And it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.”
22 Moreover the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
23 “Take thou also unto thee principal spices: of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half as much (even two hundred and fifty shekels), and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,
24 and of cassia five hundred shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.
25 And thou shalt make from it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound according to the art of the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the Testimony,
27 and the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,
28 and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot;
29 and thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy. Whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.
30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office.
31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations.
32 Upon man’s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, according to the composition of it. It is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.
33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.’”
34 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Take unto thee sweet spices: stacte and onycha and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense, of each shall there be a like weight.
35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection according to the art of the perfumer, tempered together, pure and holy.
36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation where I will meet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy.
37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make it for yourselves according to the composition thereof; it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord.
38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.”
Exodus 31 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
31 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
3 And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship,
4 to devise skillful works: to work in gold and in silver and in brass,
5 and in cutting of stones to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are wisehearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
7 the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,
8 and the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,
9 and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,
10 and the clothes of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office,
11 and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.”
13 “Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the Lord who doth sanctify you.
14 Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you. Every one who defileth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
15 Six days may work be done, but on the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord. Whosoever doeth any work on the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
16 Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant.
17 It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’”
18 And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of communing with him upon Mount Sinai, two tablets of testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.
Exodus 32 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
32 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him, “Arise, make us gods which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.”
2 And Aaron said unto them, “Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.”
3 And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
4 And he received them from their hand, and fashioned it with an engraving tool after he had made it a molten calf; and they said, “These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!”
5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, “Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord.”
6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
7 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go, get thee down; for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.
8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed thereunto and said, ‘These are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!’”
9 And the Lord said unto Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiffnecked people.
10 Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation.”
11 And Moses besought the Lord his God and said, “Lord, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people, whom Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
12 Why should the Egyptians speak and say, ‘For mischief did He bring them out, to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against Thy people.
13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants to whom Thou sworest by Thine own self and saidst unto them, ‘I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.’”
14 And the Lord repented of the evil which He thought to do unto His people.
15 And Moses turned and went down from the mount, and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand. The tablets were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
16 And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tablets.
17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.”
18 And Moses said, “It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear.”
19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them beneath the mount.
20 And he took the calf which they had made and burned it in the fire and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water and made the children of Israel drink of it.
21 And Moses said unto Aaron, “What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?”
22 And Aaron said, “Let not the anger of my lord wax hot. Thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.
23 For they said unto me, ‘Make us gods which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.’
24 And I said unto them, ‘Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off.’ So they gave it to me. Then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.”
25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies),
26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, “Who is on the Lord’S side? Let him come unto me.” And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
27 And he said unto them, “Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: ‘Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’”
28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
29 For Moses had said, “Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son and upon his brother, that He may bestow upon you a blessing this day.”
30 And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses said unto the people, “Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up unto the Lord. Perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin.”
31 And Moses returned unto the Lord and said, “Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.
32 Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin — and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written!”
33 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book.
34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, Mine angel shall go before thee. Nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.”
35 And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.
Exodus 33 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
33 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Depart and go up hence, thou and the people whom thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘Unto thy seed will I give it.’
2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite”
3 unto a land flowing with milk and honey. For I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee on the way.”
4 And when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned, and no man put on his ornaments.
5 For the Lord had said unto Moses, “Say unto the children of Israel, ‘Ye are a stiffnecked people. I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee. Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.’”
6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.
7 And Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass that every one who sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was outside the camp.
8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle.
9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.
10 And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door; and all the people rose up and worshiped, every man in his tent door.
11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he returned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
12 And Moses said unto the Lord, “See, Thou sayest unto me, ‘Bring up this people,’ and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me. Yet Thou hast said, ‘I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in My sight.’
13 Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thy way, that I may know Thee, that I may find grace in Thy sight; and consider that this nation is Thy people.”
14 And He said, “My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.”
15 And he said unto Him, “If Thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.
16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and Thy people have found grace in Thy sight? Is it not in that Thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and Thy people, from all the people who are upon the face of the earth.”
17 And the Lord said unto Moses, “I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found grace in My sight, and I know thee by name.”
18 And he said, “I beseech Thee, show me Thy glory.”
19 And He said, “I will make all My goodness pass before thee; and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.”
20 And He said, “Thou canst not see My face, for there shall no man see Me and live.”
21 And the Lord said, “Behold, there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock.
22 And it shall come to pass, while My glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand while I pass by;
23 and I will take away Mine hand, and thou shalt see My back parts, but My face shall not be seen.”
Exodus 34 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
34 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Hew thee two tablets of stone like unto the first, and I will write upon these tablets the words that were in the first tablets which thou brokest.
2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount.
3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.”
4 And he hewed two tablets of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tablets of stone.
5 And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord.
6 And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
7 keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children unto the third and to the fourth generation.”
8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
9 And he said, “If now I have found grace in Thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray Thee, go among us, for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance.”
10 And He said, “Behold, I make a covenant. Before all thy people I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom thou art shall see the work of the Lord, for it is a fearsome thing that I will do with thee.
11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day. Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite and the Canaanite, and the Hittite and the Perizzite, and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee.
13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their Asherah poles.
14 For thou shalt worship no other god; for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God,
15 lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice,
16 and thou take their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
17 “Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
18 “The Feast of Unleavened Bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
19 “All that openeth the womb is Mine, and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before Me empty.
21 “Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
22 And thou shalt observe the Feast of Weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year’s end.
23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.
24 For I will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders; neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.
25 “Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until the morning.
26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother’s milk.”
27 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Write thou these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.”
28 And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And He wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.
29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him.
30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.
31 And Moses called unto them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him; and Moses talked with them.
32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh, and he gave them in commandments all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.
33 And until Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
34 But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he took the veil off until he came out. And he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone; and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.
Exodus 35 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
35 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together and said unto them, “These are the words which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them:
2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be for you a holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the Lord. Whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.
3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath day.”
4 And Moses spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the Lord commanded, saying,
5 ‘Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord. Whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord: gold and silver and brass;
6 and blue and purple and scarlet, and fine linen and goats’ hair;
7 and rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood;
8 and oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil and for the sweet incense;
9 and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.
10 “‘And every wisehearted among you shall come and make all that the Lord hath commanded:
11 the tabernacle, his tent and his covering, his clasps, and his boards, his bars, his pillars and his sockets;
12 the ark and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat and the veil of the covering;
13 the table and his staves and all his vessels, and the showbread;
14 the candlestick also for the light, and his furniture and his lamps with the oil for the light;
15 and the incense altar and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle;
16 the altar of burnt offering with his brazen grate, his staves and all his vessels, the laver and his foot;
17 the hangings of the court, his pillars and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court;
18 the pegs of the tabernacle, and the pegs of the court and their cords;
19 the clothes of service to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office.’”
20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
21 And they came every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the Lord’S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service and for the holy garments.
22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willinghearted, and brought bracelets and earrings, and rings and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man who offered, offered an offering of gold unto the Lord.
23 And every man with whom was found blue and purple and scarlet, and fine linen and goats’ hair, and red skins of rams and badgers’ skins, brought them.
24 Every one who offered an offering of silver and brass brought the Lord’S offering; and every man with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service brought it.
25 And all the women who were wisehearted spun with their hands and brought that which they had spun, both of blue and of purple, and of scarlet and of fine linen.
26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats’ hair.
27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate,
28 and spices, and oil for the light and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord, every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.
30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, “See, the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah.
31 And He hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
32 and to devise skillful works, to work in gold and in silver and in brass,
33 and in the cutting of stones to set them, and in carving of wood to make any manner of skillful work.
34 And He hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan.
35 Them hath He filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work of the engraver and of the skilled workman, and of the embroiderer in blue and in purple, in scarlet and in fine linen, and of the weaver —even of those who do any work and of those who devise skillful work.”
Exodus 36 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
36 Then Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wisehearted man in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, wrought according to all that the Lord had commanded.
2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wisehearted man in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up, to come unto the work to do it.
3 And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it thereby. And they brought yet unto him freewill offerings every morning.
4 And all the wise men who wrought all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they made,
5 and they spoke unto Moses, saying, “The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded to make.”
6 And Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing,
7 for the supply they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
8 And every wisehearted man among them who wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of finetwined linen, and blue and purple and scarlet; with cherubims of skillful work made he them.
9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits; the curtains were all of one size.
10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another, and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.
11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvage in the coupling. Likewise he made in the outermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.
12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second; the loops held one curtain to another.
13 And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the clasps. So it became one tabernacle.
14 And he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he made them.
15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain; the eleven curtains were of one size.
16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves.
17 And he made fifty loops upon the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
18 And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers’ skins above that.
20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing upright.
21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.
22 One board had two tenons equally distant one from another. Thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
23 And he made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward.
24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards: two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.
25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards
26 and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
29 And they were coupled beneath and coupled together at the head thereof to one ring; thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
30 And there were eight boards, and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
31 And he made bars of shittim wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
32 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.
33 And he made the middle bar to extend through the boards from the one end to the other.
34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
35 And he made a veil of blue and purple and scarlet, and finetwined linen; with cherubims he made it of skillful work.
36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four sockets of silver.
37 And he made a hanging for the tabernacle door of blue and purple and scarlet, and finetwined linen, of needlework,
38 and the five pillars of it with their hooks. And he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold, but their five sockets were of brass.
Exodus 37 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
37 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood. Two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it.
2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold for it round about.
3 And he cast for it four rings of gold to be set in the four corners of it: even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.
4 And he made staves of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold.
5 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
6 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold. Two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
7 And he made two cherubims of gold. Beaten out of one piece made he them on the two ends of the mercy seat:
8 one cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side; out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.
9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered over the mercy seat with their wings with their faces one toward another; even toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubims.
10 And he made the table of shittim wood. Two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.
12 Also he made thereunto a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.
13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.
14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.
15 And he made the staves of shittim wood to bear the table, and overlaid them with gold.
16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table — his dishes and his spoons and his bowls and his covers for covering — of pure gold.
17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work made he the candlestick. His shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his buds and his flowers were of the same.
18 And six branches came out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof.
19 Three bowls were made after the fashion of almonds on one branch, with a bud and a flower, and three bowls were made like almonds on another branch, with a bud and a flower — so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.
20 And on the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, with his buds and his flowers,
21 and a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.
22 Their buds and their branches were of the same; all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.
23 And he made his seven lamps and his snuffers and his snuff dishes of pure gold.
24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.
25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood. The length of it was a cubit and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare, and two cubits was the height of it. The horns thereof were of the same.
26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it; also he made for it a crown of gold round about.
27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it.
28 And he made the staves of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold.
29 And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the perfumer.
Exodus 38 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
38 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood; five cubits was the length thereof and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare, and three cubits the height thereof.
2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same, and he overlaid it with brass.
3 And he made all the vessels of the altar: the pots and the shovels and the basins, and the fleshhooks and the firepans; all the vessels thereof made he of brass.
4 And he made for the altar a brazen grate of network, under the rim thereof beneath, unto the midst of it.
5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves.
6 And he made the staves of shittim wood and overlaid them with brass.
7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar to bear it; he made the altar hollow with boards.
8 And he made the laver of brass and the foot of it from brass, from the looking glasses of the women assembling, who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of finetwined linen, a hundred cubits.
10 Their pillars were twenty and their brazen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
11 And for the north side the hangings were a hundred cubits. Their pillars were twenty and their sockets of brass twenty, the hooks of the pillars and their fillets, of silver.
12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten and their sockets ten, the hooks of the pillars and their fillets, of silver.
13 And for the east side eastward, fifty cubits.
14 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, their pillars three and their sockets three.
15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this side and that side, were hangings of fifteen cubits, their pillars three and their sockets three.
16 All the hangings of the court round about were of finetwined linen.
17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass, the hooks of the pillars and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver, and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.
18 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework: of blue and purple and scarlet, and finetwined linen; and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
19 And their pillars were four and their sockets of brass four; their hooks, of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets, of silver.
20 And all the pegs of the tabernacle and of the court round about were of brass.
21 This is the account of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted according to the commandment of Moses for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.
22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the Lord commanded Moses.
23 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet, and fine linen.
24 All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
25 And the silver of those who were numbered in the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary:
26 a bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one who went to be numbered from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.
27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil: a hundred sockets from the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals and filleted them.
29 And the brass from the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
30 And therewith he made the sockets for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar and the brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,
31 and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs of the court round about.
Exodus 39 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
39 And of the blue and purple and scarlet they made clothes of service to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron, as the Lord commanded Moses.
2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue and purple and scarlet, and finetwined linen.
3 And they beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires to work it in the blue and in the purple and in the scarlet and in the fine linen, with skillful work.
4 They made shoulder pieces for it to couple it together; by the two edges was it coupled together.
5 And the embroidered girdle of his ephod that was upon it was of the same, according to the work thereof: of gold, blue and purple and scarlet, and finetwined linen, as the Lord commanded Moses.
6 And they wrought onyx stones enclosed in clasps of gold, graven as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.
7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel, as the Lord commanded Moses.
8 And he made the breastplate of skillful work, like the work of the ephod: of gold, blue and purple and scarlet, and finetwined linen.
9 It was foursquare. They made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.
10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz and a carbuncle; this was the first row;
11 and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;
12 and the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst;
13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in clasps of gold in their enclosings.
14 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel — twelve, according to their names like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name according to the twelve tribes.
15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathed work of pure gold.
16 And they made two clasps of gold and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
17 And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate;
18 and the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened in the two clasps, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
19 And they made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it which was on the side of the ephod inward;
20 and they made two other golden rings and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the front of it over against the other coupling thereof, above the embroidered girdle of the ephod.
21 And they bound the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the embroidered girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod, as the Lord commanded Moses.
22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
23 And there was a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of a jacket of mail, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.
24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet, and twined linen.
25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates:
26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in, as the Lord commanded Moses.
27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron and for his sons,
28 and a miter of fine linen and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of finetwined linen,
29 and a girdle of finetwined linen, and blue and purple and scarlet needlework, as the Lord commanded Moses.
30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: Holiness to the Lord.
31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue to fasten it on high upon the miter, as the Lord commanded Moses.
32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished, and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses; so did they.
33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses: the tent and all his furniture, his clasps, his boards, his bars and his pillars and his sockets;
34 and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers’ skins, and the veil of the covering;
35 the ark of the Testimony and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat;
36 the table and all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;
37 the pure candlestick with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light;
38 and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door;
39 the brazen altar and his grate of brass, his staves and all his vessels, the laver and his foot;
40 the hangings of the court, his pillars and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords and his pegs, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle for the tent of the congregation;
41 the clothes of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and his sons’ garments to minister in the priest’s office.
42 According to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.
43 And Moses looked upon all the work, and behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded; even so had they done it. And Moses blessed them.
Exodus 40 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
40 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the Testimony, and cover the ark with the veil.
4 And thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light the lamps thereof.
5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony, and put up the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.
9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it and all the vessels thereof; and it shall be holy.
10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar; and it shall be an altar most holy.
11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.
12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.
13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him and sanctify him, that he may minister unto Me in the priest’s office.
14 And thou shalt bring his sons and clothe them with coats;
15 and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office. For their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.”
16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he.
17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof and reared up his pillars.
19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it, as the Lord commanded Moses.
20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark.
21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the covering and covered the ark of the Testimony, as the Lord commanded Moses.
22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation upon the side of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil.
23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
25 And he lighted the lamps before the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil;
27 and he burned sweet incense thereon, as the Lord commanded Moses.
28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.
29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering, as the Lord commanded Moses.
30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there for washing.
31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat.
32 When they went into the tent of the congregation and when they came near unto the altar, they washed, as the Lord commanded Moses.
33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys;
37 but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not until the day that it was taken up.
38 For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.
Leviticus 1 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
1 And the Lord called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd and of the flock.
3 “‘If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish. He shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord.
4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
5 And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
6 And he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into his pieces.
7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire.
8 And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar;
9 but his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water. And the priest shall burn all on the altar to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
10 “‘And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice, he shall bring a male without blemish.
11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.
12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar,
13 but he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water. And the priest shall bring it all and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
14 “‘And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or of young pigeons.
15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar.
16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes.
17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder. And the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
Leviticus 2 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
2 “‘And when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense thereon.
2 And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take from it his handful of the flour thereof and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
3 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings to the Lord made by fire.
4 “‘And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mingled with oil.
6 Thou shalt part it in pieces and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.
7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baked in the frying pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the Lord; and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.
9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire.
11 “‘No meat offering which ye shall bring unto the Lord shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven nor any honey in any offering of the Lord made by fire.
12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord, but they shall not be burned on the altar for a sweet savor.
13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou allow the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering. With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the Lord, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.
15 And thou shalt put oil upon it and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.
16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
Leviticus 3 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
3 “‘And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd, whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord.
2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
3 And he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord: the fat that covereth the inwards and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
4 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys — it shall he take away.
5 And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
6 “‘And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the Lord be of the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the Lord.
8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation; and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.
9 And he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat thereof and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone: and the fat that covereth the inwards and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
10 and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys — it shall he take away.
11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord.
12 “‘And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the Lord.
13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord: the fat that covereth the inwards and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
15 and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys — it shall he take away.
16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savor; all the fat is the Lord’S.
17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.’”
Leviticus 4 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
4 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them,
3 if the priest who is anointed shall sin, bringing the sin upon the people, then let him bring for his sin which he hath sinned a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering.
4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord, and shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head and kill the bullock before the Lord.
5 And the priest who is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation;
6 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.
7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering: the fat that covereth the inwards and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
9 and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys — it shall he take away,
10 as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.
11 And the skin of the bullock and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung”
12 even the whole bullock shall he carry forth outside the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out shall he be burned.
13 “‘And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done something against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty,
14 when the sin which they have sinned is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.
15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the Lord; and the bullock shall be killed before the Lord.
16 And the priest who is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation;
17 and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, even before the veil.
18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
19 And he shall take all his fat from him and burn it upon the altar.
20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering; so shall he do with this. And the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
21 And he shall carry forth the bullock outside the camp and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.
22 “‘When a ruler hath sinned, and done something through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty,
23 or if his sin wherein he hath sinned come to his knowledge, he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish.
24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord: it is a sin offering.
25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.
26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
27 “‘And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance while he doeth something against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty,
28 or if his sin which he hath sinned come to his knowledge, then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.
30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.
31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto the Lord; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
32 “‘And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.
34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.
35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord; and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.
Leviticus 5 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
5 “‘And if a soul sin and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it, if he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.
2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him, he also shall be unclean and guilty.
3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be, that a man shall be defiled thereby, and it be hid from him, when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.
4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him, when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.
5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing;
6 and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.
7 “‘And if he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons unto the Lord: one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder.
9 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.
10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
11 “‘But if he is not able to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon, for it is a sin offering.
12 Then shall he bring it to the priest and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord: it is a sin offering.
13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him; and the remnant shall be the priest’s as a meat offering.’”
14 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
15 “If a soul commit a trespass and sin through ignorance in the holy things of the Lord, then he shall bring for his trespass unto the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy valuation in shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.
16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add a fifth part thereto and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
17 “And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord, though he knew it not, yet is he guilty and shall bear his iniquity.
18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation for a trespass offering unto the priest; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him.
19 It is a trespass offering; he hath certainly trespassed against the Lord.”
Leviticus 6 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
6 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “If a soul sin and commit a trespass against the Lord by lying unto his neighbor about that which was delivered to him to keep, or in dealings, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbor,
3 or has found that which was lost and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely — in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein,
4 then it shall be, because he hath sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
5 or all that about which he hath sworn falsely. He shall even restore the principal thereof, and shall add a fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, on the day of his trespassoffering.
6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest.
7 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord; and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.”
8 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
9 “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar; and he shall put them beside the altar.
11 And he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes outside the camp unto a clean place.
12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.
13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
14 “‘And this is the law of the meat offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, before the altar.
15 And he shall take from it his handful of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, even the memorial of it unto the Lord.
16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat. With unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
17 It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering and as the trespass offering.
18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire. Every one who toucheth them shall be holy.’”
19 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
20 “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord in the day when he is anointed: a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a perpetual meat offering, half of it in the morning and half thereof at night.
21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked thou shalt bring it in, and the baked pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
22 And the priest from among his sons, who is anointed in his stead, shall offer it. It is a statute for ever unto the Lord; it shall be wholly burned.
23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burned; it shall not be eaten.”
24 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
25 “Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord; it is most holy.
26 The priest who offereth it for sin shall eat it; in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.
28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken; and if it is boiled in a brazen pot, it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water.
29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof; it is most holy.
30 And no sin offering, from which any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation for reconcilement thereby in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burned in the fire.
Leviticus 7 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
7 “‘Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering (it is most holy):
2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
3 And he shall offer from it all the fat thereof: the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
4 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys; it shall he take away.
5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord: it is a trespass offering.
6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof. It shall be eaten in the holy place; it is most holy.
7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering; there is one law for them: the priest who maketh atonement therewith shall have it.
8 And the priest who offereth any man’s burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.
9 And all the meat offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying pan and in the pan, shall be the priest’s who offereth it.
10 And every meat offering mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.
11 “‘And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which he shall offer unto the Lord:
12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil of fine flour, fried.
13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for a heave offering unto the Lord, and it shall be the priest’s who sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.
15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten.
17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it; it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
19 “‘And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire; and as for the flesh, all who are clean shall eat thereof.
20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man or any unclean beast or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.’”
22 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
23 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox or of sheep or of goat.
24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself and the fat of that which is torn by beasts may be used in any other use, but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood in any of your dwellings, whether it be of fowl or of beast.
27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.’”
28 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
29 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire; the fat with the breast it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the Lord.
31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for a heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
33 He among the sons of Aaron who offereth the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.
34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever, from among the children of Israel.’”
35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron and of the anointing of his sons out of the offerings to the Lord made by fire, on the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest’s office,
36 which the Lord commanded to be given them by the children of Israel on the day that He anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.
37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings,
38 which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day that He commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord in the Wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus 8 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
8 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;
3 and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.”
4 And Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
5 And Moses said unto the congregation: “This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done.”
6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the woven girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
8 And he put the breastplate upon him. Also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
9 And he put the miter upon his head. Also upon the miter, even upon the front thereof, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown, as the Lord commanded Moses.
10 And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.
12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head and anointed him, to sanctify him.
13 And Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put headdresses upon them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.
17 But the bullock and his hide, his flesh, and his dung he burned with fire outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat.
21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burned the whole ram upon the altar. It was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savor, and an offering made by fire unto the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot.
24 And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear and upon the thumbs of their right hands and upon the great toes of their right feet; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right shoulder;
26 and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord he took one unleavened cake and a cake of oiled bread and one wafer, and put them on the fat and upon the right shoulder.
27 And he put all upon Aaron’s hands and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord.
28 And Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar upon the burnt offering. They were consecrations for a sweet savor; it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
29 And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord; for of the ram of consecration, it was Moses’ part, as the Lord commanded Moses.
30 And Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his garments, and upon his sons and upon his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’
32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation for seven days, until the days of your consecration are at an end; for seven days shall He consecrate you.
34 As He hath done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not; for so I am commanded.”
36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus 9 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
9 And it came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
2 and he said unto Aaron, “Take thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.
3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, ‘Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering,
4 also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the Lord, and a meat offering mingled with oil; for today the Lord will appear unto you.’”
5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord.
6 And Moses said, “This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do, and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.”
7 And Moses said unto Aaron, “Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself and for the people; and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them, as the Lord commanded.”
8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar;
10 but the fat, and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar, as the Lord commanded Moses.
11 And the flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.
12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof and the head; and he burned them upon the altar.
14 And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burned them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
15 And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it and offered it for sin, as the first.
16 And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
17 And he brought the meat offering, and took a handful thereof and burned it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
19 and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver.
20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat upon the altar.
21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses commanded.
22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings.
23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out and blessed the people; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people.
24 And there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat, which when all the people saw, they shouted and fell on their faces.
Leviticus 10 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
10 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer and put fire therein, and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not.
2 And there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.
3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, “This is that which the Lord spoke, saying, ‘I will be sanctified in them that come nigh Me, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” And Aaron held his peace.
4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, “Come near; carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.”
5 So they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
6 And Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, “Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes, lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people; but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled.
7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.
8 And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, saying,
9 “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die. It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations,
10 that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean,
11 and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.”
12 And Moses spoke unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons who were left: “Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy.
13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due and thy sons’ due of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire; for so I am commanded.
14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for they are thy due and thy sons’ due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be thine and thy sons’ with thee by a statute for ever, as the Lord hath commanded.”
16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned; and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left alive, saying,
17 “Why have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?
18 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place; ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.”
19 And Aaron said unto Moses, “Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, and such things have befallen me. And if I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord?”
20 And when Moses heard that, he was content.
Leviticus 11 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof and is cloven-footed and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat, of those that chew the cud or of those that divide the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you;
5 and the coney, because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you;
6 and the hare, because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you;
7 and the swine, though he divide the hoof and is cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud, he is unclean to you.
8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
9 “‘These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you.
11 They shall be even an abomination unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall hold their carcasses in abomination.
12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
13 “‘And these are they which ye shall hold in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the osprey,
14 and the vulture, and the kite after his kind,
15 every raven after his kind,
16 and the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind,
17 and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
18 and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
19 and the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
20 “‘All fowls that creep, going upon all fours, shall be an abomination unto you.
21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all fours, which have legs above their feet with which to leap upon the earth;
22 even these of them ye may eat: the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.
23 But all other flying creeping things which have four feet shall be an abomination unto you.
24 “‘And by these ye shall be unclean. Whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening,
25 and whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
26 The carcasses of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not cloven-footed nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you; every one who toucheth them shall be unclean.
27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all fours, those are unclean unto you; whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
28 And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean unto you.
29 “‘These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,
30 and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
31 These are unclean to you among all that creep; whosoever doth touch them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.
32 And upon whatsoever any of them when they are dead doth fall, it shall be unclean. Whether it be any vessel of wood or raiment or skin or sack, whatsoever vessel it be wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; so it shall be cleansed.
33 And every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and ye shall break it.
34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean. Whether it be an oven or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down; for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.
36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean; but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
37 And if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.
38 But if any water be put upon the seed and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.
39 “‘And if any beast of which ye may eat die, he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the evening.
40 And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. He also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
41 “‘And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat, for they are an abomination.
43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
44 For I am the Lord your God. Ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy, for I am holy; neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
45 For I am the Lord who bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. Ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
46 “‘This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth,
47 to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.’”
Leviticus 12 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
12 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman have conceived seed and borne a manchild, then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
3 And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days. She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying are fulfilled.
5 But if she bear a maidchild, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation; and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.
6 “‘And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest,
7 who shall offer it before the Lord and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath borne a male or a female.
8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for the burnt offering and the other for a sin offering, and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”
Leviticus 13 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
13 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron, saying,
2 “When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the priests.
3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh; and when the hair in the plague has turned white and the plague in appearance be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him unclean.
4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh and in appearance be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days.
5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day; and behold, if the plague in its appearance is stayed and the plague spread not in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more.
6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and behold, if the plague be somewhat dark and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is but a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again.
8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.
9 “When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest.
10 And the priest shall see him; and behold, if the rising be white in the skin and it has turned the hair white and there be living raw flesh in the rising,
11 it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
12 And if leprosy break out abroad in the skin and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh,
13 then the priest shall consider; and behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague. It has all turned white; he is clean.
14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean, for the raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.
16 Or if the raw flesh turn again and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest,
17 and the priest shall see him; and behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague; he is clean.
18 “The flesh also in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil and it is healed,
19 and in the place of the boil there be a white rising or a bright spot, white and somewhat reddish, and it be shown to the priest,
20 and if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it is in appearance lower than the skin and the hair thereof is turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
21 But if the priest look on it, and behold, there are no white hairs therein and if it is not lower than the skin, but is somewhat dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a plague.
23 But if the bright spot stay in his place and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
24 “Or if there be any flesh in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the living flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish or white,
25 then the priest shall look upon it; and behold, if the hair in the bright spot is turned white and it is in appearance deeper than the skin, it is a leprosy broken out of the burning. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.
26 But if the priest look on it, and behold, there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is no lower than the other skin, but is somewhat dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day; and if it is spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.
28 And if the bright spot stay in his place and spread not in the skin, but it is somewhat dark, it is a rising from the burning; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is an inflammation from the burning.
29 “If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard,
30 then the priest shall see the plague; and behold, if it be in appearance deeper than the skin and there is in it a yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.
31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and behold, it is not in appearance deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days.
32 And on the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and behold, if the scall spread not and there is in it no yellow hair and the scall is not in appearance deeper than the skin,
33 he shall be shaved, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more.
34 And on the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and behold, if the scall is not spread in the skin nor is in appearance deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing,
36 then the priest shall look on him; and behold, if the scall is spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.
37 But if the scall is in appearance stayed and there is black hair grown up therein, the scall is healed; he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
38 “If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots,
39 then the priest shall look; and behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white, it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.
40 “And the man whose hair has fallen off his head, he is bald, yet is he clean.
41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, his forehead is bald, yet is he clean.
42 And if there be in the bald head or bald forehead a white reddish sore, it is leprosy sprung up in his bald head or his bald forehead.
43 Then the priest shall look upon it; and behold, if the rising of the sore is reddish white in his bald head or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh,
44 he is a leprous man; he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is on his head.
45 “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip and shall cry, ‘Unclean, unclean.’
46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean. He shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be.
47 “The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woolen garment or a linen garment,
48 whether it be in the warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in a skin or in any thing made of skin,
49 and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin, either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin, it is a plague of leprosy and shall be shown unto the priest.
50 And the priest shall look upon the plague and shut up it that hath the plague seven days.
51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day; if the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in a skin or in any work that is made of skin, the plague is a consuming leprosy; it is unclean.
52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or any thing of skin wherein the plague is, for it is a consuming leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.
53 “And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague is not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any thing of skin,
54 then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more.
55 And the priest shall look on the plague after it is washed; and behold, if the plague has not changed his color and the plague is not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire. It has eaten inward, whether it be bare within or without.
56 And if the priest look, and behold, the plague is somewhat dark after the washing of it, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof.
57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin, it is a spreading plague; thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
58 And the garment, either warp or woof or whatsoever thing of skin it is which thou shalt wash, if the plague is departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time and shall be clean.”
59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.
Leviticus 14 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
14 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest.
3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp, and the priest shall look; and behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,
4 then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.
6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.
7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean; and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
9 But it shall be on the seventh day that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off, and he shall wash his clothes; also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
10 “And on the eighth day he shall take two helambs without blemish and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and threetenths part of fine flour for a meat offering mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
11 And the priest who maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
12 And the priest shall take one helamb and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.
13 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place; for as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass offering; it is most holy.
14 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot.
15 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.
16 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord;
17 and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering.
18 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord.
19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.
20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
21 “And if he be poor and cannot get so much, then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved to make an atonement for him, and onetenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil,
22 and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the Lord.
24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.
25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot;
26 and the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand.
27 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord;
28 and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering.
29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord.
30 And he shall offer one of the turtledoves or of the young pigeons, such as he can get—
31 even such as he is able to get — the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord.
32 This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.”
33 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
34 “When ye have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession,
35 and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘It seemeth to me there is, as it were, a plague in the house,’
36 then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.
37 And he shall look on the plague, and behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, which in appearance are lower than the wall,
38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut up the house seven days.
39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day and shall look; and behold, if the plague is spread in the walls of the house,
40 then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place outside the city.
41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off outside the city into an unclean place.
42 And they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house.
43 “And if the plague come again and break out in the house, after he hath taken away the stones and after he hath scraped the house and after it is plastered,
44 then the priest shall come and look; and behold, if the plague is spread in the house, it is a consuming leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
45 And he shall break down the house — the stones of it and the timber thereof and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.
47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes, and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
48 “And if the priest shall come in and look upon it, and behold, the plague hath not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
50 And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water;
51 and he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet;
53 but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.”
54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy and scall,
55 and for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,
56 and for a rising and for a scab and for a bright spot,
57 to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.
Leviticus 15 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
15 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, ‘When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.
3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue or his flesh be stopped from running with his issue, it is his uncleanness.
4 Every bed whereon he lieth who hath the issue is unclean, and every thing whereon he sitteth shall be unclean.
5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat who hath the issue shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and is unclean until the evening.
8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon who hath the issue shall be unclean.
10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the evening; and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
11 And whomsoever he toucheth who hath the issue and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
12 And the vessel of earth that he toucheth who hath the issue shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
13 “‘And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
14 And on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest.
15 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord for his issue.
16 “‘And if any man’s seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water and be unclean until the evening.
17 And every garment and every skin whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening.
18 The woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water and be unclean until the evening.
19 “‘And if a woman have an issue and her issue from her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days; and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the evening.
20 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean; every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.
21 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
22 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
23 And if it be on her bed or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the evening.
24 And if any man lie with her at all and her monthly discharge be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.
25 “‘And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation, all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation; she shall be unclean.
26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation; and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.
27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
28 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
29 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
30 And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness.
31 “‘Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness when they defile My tabernacle that is among them.’”
32 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him and is defiled therewith,
33 and of her that is sick with her monthly discharge, and of him that hath an issue, of the man and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
Leviticus 16 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord, and died;
2 and the Lord said unto Moses, “Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the Holy Place within the veil before the mercy seat which is upon the ark, that he die not; for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.
3 Thus shall Aaron come into the Holy Place: with a young bullock for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen miter shall he be attired. These are holy garments. Therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.
5 And he shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself and for his house.
7 And he shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats — one lot for the Lord and the other lot for the scapegoat.
9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord’S lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.
10 But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him and to let him go as a scapegoat into the wilderness.
11 “And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself.
12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it inside the veil.
13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not.
14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.
16 And he shall make an atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel and because of their transgressions in all their sins; and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the Holy Place until he come out, and has made an atonement for himself and for his household and for all the congregation of Israel.
18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord and make an atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
20 “And when he hath made an end of reconciling the Holy Place and the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, he shall bring the live goat.
21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness.
22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited; and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
23 “And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Holy Place and shall leave them there;
24 and he shall wash his flesh with water in the Holy Place and put on his garments, and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself and for the people.
25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.
26 And he that let go the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
27 And the bullock for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall one carry forth outside the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung.
28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
29 “And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country or a stranger who sojourneth among you;
30 for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.
31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.
32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest’s office in his father’s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments;
33 and he shall make an atonement for the Holy Sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests and for all the people of the congregation.
34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you: to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.” And he did as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus 17 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: ‘This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying:
3 Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel who killeth an ox or lamb or goat in the camp, or who killeth it out of the camp,
4 and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord, blood shall be imputed unto that man: he hath shed blood. And that man shall be cut off from among his people,
5 to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord.
6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.’
8 “And thou shalt say unto them: ‘Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,
9 and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it unto the Lord, even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
10 “‘And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who eateth any manner of blood, I will even set My face against that soul who eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people.
11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, “No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.”
13 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust.
14 For it is the life of all flesh: the blood of it is for the life thereof. Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, “Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh, for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof. Whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.”
15 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that which was torn by beasts, whether it be one of your own country or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening; then shall he be clean.
16 But if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.’”
Leviticus 18 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
18 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘I am the Lord your God.
3 According to the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and according to the doings of the land of Canaan whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
4 Ye shall do My judgments and keep Mine ordinances to walk therein; I am the Lord your God.
5 Ye shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.
6 “‘None of you shall approach any who is near of kin to him to uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord.
7 The nakedness of thy father or the nakedness of thy mother shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
8 The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father’s nakedness.
9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
10 The nakedness of thy son’s daughter or of thy daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine own nakedness.
11 The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is thy father’s near kinswoman.
13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman.
14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother. Thou shalt not approach his wife: she is thine aunt.
15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness.
17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter to uncover her nakedness: for they are her near kinswomen; it is wickedness.
18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister to vex her, to uncover her nakedness beside the other in her life time.
19 “‘Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor’s wife, to defile thyself with her.
21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.
22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination.
23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith, neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.
24 “‘Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things, for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you,
25 and the land is defiled. Therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
26 Ye shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations, neither any of your own nation nor any stranger who sojourneth among you
27 (for all these abominations have the men of the land done, who were before you, and the land is defiled),
28 that the land spew not you out also when ye defile it, as it spewed out the nations that were before you.
29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls who commit them shall be cut off from among their people.
30 Therefore shall ye keep Mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God.’”
Leviticus 19 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
19 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them: ‘Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.
3 Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father, and keep My Sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.
4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.
5 “‘And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, ye shall offer it at your own will.
6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow; and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burned in the fire.
7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.
8 Therefore every one who eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
9 “‘And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.
10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard. Thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the Lord your God.
11 “‘Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.
12 And ye shall not swear by My name falsely; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.
13 “‘Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him. The wages of him that is hired shall not remain with thee all night until the morning.
14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord.
15 “‘Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty, but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
16 “‘Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am the Lord.
17 “‘Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart. Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not let sin come upon him.
18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord.
19 “‘Ye shall keep My statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle breed with a diverse kind. Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed; neither shall a garment mingled with linen and wool come upon thee.
20 “‘And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman who is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed nor freedom given her, she shall be scourged. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: even a ram for a trespass offering.
22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done, and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.
23 “‘And when ye shall come into the land and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised. Three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you. It shall not be eaten of.
24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy with which to praise the Lord.
25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the Lord your God.
26 “‘Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood; neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe omens.
27 Ye shall not round off the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the Lord.
29 “‘Do not prostitute thy daughter to cause her to be a whore, lest the land fall to whoredom and the land become full of wickedness.
30 Ye shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary: I am the Lord.
31 “‘Regard not those who have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.
32 “‘Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.
33 “‘And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.
34 But the stranger who dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
35 “‘Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measuring length, weight, or number.
36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin shall ye have: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
37 Therefore shall ye observe all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them: I am the Lord.’”
Leviticus 20 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
20 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel: ‘Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who giveth any of his seed unto Molech, he shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
3 And I will set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name.
4 And if the people of the land do in any way hide their eyes from the man when he giveth of his seed unto Molech and kill him not,
5 then I will set My face against that man and against his family and will cut him off, and all who go a whoring after him to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
6 “‘And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits and after wizards to go a whoring after them, I will even set My face against that soul and will cut him off from among his people.
7 “‘Sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy, for I am the Lord your God.
8 “‘And ye shall keep My statutes and do them: I am the Lord who sanctify you.
9 “‘For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death. He hath cursed his father or his mother: his blood shall be upon him.
10 “‘And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
11 And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness. Both of them shall surely be put to death: their blood shall be upon them.
12 And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have wrought confusion: their blood shall be upon them.
13 “‘If a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death: their blood shall be upon them.
14 “‘And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you.
15 “‘And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death; and ye shall slay the beast.
16 And if a woman approach unto any beast and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman and the beast. They shall surely be put to death: their blood shall be upon them.
17 “‘And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness and she see his nakedness, it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people. He hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness: he shall bear his iniquity.
18 “‘And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness and shall uncover her nakedness, he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood; and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister nor of thy father’s sister, for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They shall bear their sin: they shall die childless.
21 And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing. He hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness: they shall be childless.
22 “‘Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them, that the land whither I bring you to dwell therein spew you not out.
23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation which I cast out before you; for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
24 But I have said unto you, “Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey.” I am the Lord your God, who have separated you from other people.
25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean; and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
26 And ye shall be holy unto Me; for I the Lord am holy and have severed you from other people, that ye should be Mine.
27 “‘A man also or woman who hath a familiar spirit, or who is a wizard, shall surely be put to death. They shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.’”
Leviticus 21 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
21 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them: ‘There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people,
2 except for his kin who is near unto him, that is: for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
3 and for his sister, a virgin who is nigh unto him, who hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.
4 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
6 They shall be holy unto their God and not profane the name of their God, for the offerings of the Lord made by fire and the bread of their God they do offer; therefore they shall be holy.
7 They shall not take a wife who is a whore or profane, neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is holy unto his God.
8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore, for he offereth the bread of thy God. He shall be holy unto thee; for I the Lord, who sanctify you, am holy.
9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father. She shall be burned with fire.
10 “‘And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head nor rend his clothes;
11 neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father or for his mother;
12 neither shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the Lord.
13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
14 A widow or a divorced woman or profane or a harlot, these shall he not take; but he shall take a virgin of his own people for a wife.
15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people, for I the Lord do sanctify him.’”
16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
17 “Speak unto Aaron, saying, ‘Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations who hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
19 or a man who is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
20 or crookbacked, or a dwarf, or who hath a blemish in his eye, or hath scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken—
21 no man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire. He hath a blemish: he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy.
23 Only he shall not go in unto the veil nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish, that he profane not My sanctuaries; for I the Lord do sanctify them.’”
24 And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
Leviticus 22 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
22 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not My holy name in those things which they hallow unto Me: I am the Lord.
3 Say unto them: ‘Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, who goeth unto the holy things which the children of Israel hallow unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from My presence: I am the Lord.
4 Whatsoever man of the seed of Aaron is a leper or hath a running issue, he shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him,
5 or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath—
6 the soul who hath touched any such shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy things unless he wash his flesh with water.
7 And when the sun is down he shall be clean, and shall afterwards eat of the holy things, because it is his food.
8 That which dieth of itself or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the Lord.
9 They shall therefore keep Mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it and die therefore if they profane it: I the Lord do sanctify them.
10 “‘There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing. A sojourner of the priest or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing.
11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house; they shall eat of his meat.
12 If the priest’s daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
13 But if the priest’s daughter be a widow or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s meat; but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put a fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.
15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord,
16 or allow them to bear the iniquity of trespass when they eat their holy things: for I the Lord do sanctify them.’”
17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
18 “Speak unto Aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: ‘Whosoever he be of the house of Israel or of the strangers in Israel, who will offer his oblation for all his vows and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the Lord for a burnt offering”
19 ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
20 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer; for it shall not be acceptable for you.
21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the Lord, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the Lord.
23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering, but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
24 Ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.
25 Neither from a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them and blemishes are in them; they shall not be accepted for you.’”
26 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
27 “When a bullock or a sheep or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven days with its dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
28 And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord, offer it at your own will.
30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the Lord.
31 “Therefore shall ye keep My commandments and do them: I am the Lord.
32 Neither shall ye profane My holy name, but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel. I am the Lord who hallow you,
33 that brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the Lord.”
Leviticus 23 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘Concerning the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My feasts.
3 “‘Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a holy convocation. Ye shall do no work therein; it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.
4 “‘These are the feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
5 On the fourteenth day of the first month at evening is the Lord’S Passover.
6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread unto the Lord; seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
7 On the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work therein.
8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work therein.’”
9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
10 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘When ye come into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest.
11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf a helamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord.
13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two-tenths part of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet savor; and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, a fourth part of a hin.
14 And ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
15 “‘And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be complete.
16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number fifty days, and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord.
17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two-tenths part. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the Lord.
18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock and two rams; they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savor unto the Lord.
19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the Lord with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.
21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day that it may be a holy convocation unto you. Ye shall do no servile work therein; it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
22 “‘And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not rid cleanly the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleanings of thy harvest. Thou shalt leave them unto the poor and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God.’”
23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
24 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
25 Ye shall do no servile work therein, but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.’”
26 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
27 “Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
28 And ye shall do no work in that same day, for it is a Day of Atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God.
29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
31 Ye shall do no manner of work; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls. On the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening unto evening, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.”
33 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
34 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord.
35 On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work therein.
36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. It is a solemn assembly, and ye shall do no servile work therein.
37 “‘These are the feasts of the Lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering and a meat offering, a sacrifice and drink offerings, every thing upon his day”
38 besides the Sabbaths of the Lord, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings which ye give unto the Lord.
39 “‘Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days; on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.
40 And ye shall take for yourselves on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.
41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths,
43 that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.’”
44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the Lord.
Leviticus 24 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
24 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure olive oil, beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
3 Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the Lord continually; it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.
4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the Lord continually.
5 “And thou shalt take fine flour and bake twelve cakes thereof, twotenths part shall be in one cake.
6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the Lord.
7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
8 Every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
9 And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy place, for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statute.”
10 And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.
11 And the Israelite woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses (his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan);
12 and they put him under guard, that the mind of the Lord might be shown them.
13 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
14 “Bring forth him that hath cursed outside the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him. As well the stranger as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.
17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good, beast for beast.
19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor, as he hath done, so shall it be done to him—
20 breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.
21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it; and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger as for one of your own country; for I am the Lord your God.’”
23 And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus 25 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
25 And the Lord spoke unto Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord.
3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof,
4 but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the Lord; thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard.
5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed; for it is a year of rest unto the land.
6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you: for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger who sojourneth with thee;
7 and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat.
8 “‘And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof. It shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
11 A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
12 For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy unto you; ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
13 “‘In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
14 And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor or buyest aught of thy neighbor’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another.
15 According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy from thy neighbor, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee.
16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another, but thou shalt fear thy God; for I am the Lord your God.
18 “‘Therefore ye shall do My statutes, and keep My judgments and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety.
20 And if ye shall say, “What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our increase.”
21 Then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
23 The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is Mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with Me.
24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
25 “‘If thy brother waxeth poor and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and he himself is able to redeem it,
27 then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it, that he may return unto his possession.
28 But if he is not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the Year of Jubilee; and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
29 “‘And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
30 And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee.
31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
32 Notwithstanding, the cities of the Levites and the houses of the cities of their possession may the Levites redeem at any time.
33 And if a man purchase from the Levites, then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the Year of Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.
35 “‘And if thy brother be waxed poor and hath fallen into ruin with thee, then thou shalt relieve him, yea, though he be a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with thee.
36 Take thou no interest from him or increase; but fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee.
37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
38 I am the Lord your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
39 “‘And if thy brother who dwelleth by thee be waxed poor and is sold unto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant;
40 but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the Year of Jubilee.
41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
42 For they are My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bondmen.
43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
44 Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen who are round about you. From them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
45 Moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, from them shall ye buy and from their families who are with you, whom they begot in your land; and they shall be your possession.
46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession. They shall be your bondmen for ever. But over your brethren, the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigor.
47 “‘And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother who dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family,
48 after he is sold he may be redeemed again. One of his brethren may redeem him:
49 either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he is able, he may redeem himself.
50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the Year of Jubilee; and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him.
51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
52 And if there remain but few years unto the Year of Jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him, and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
54 And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the Year of Jubilee, both he and his children with him.
55 For unto Me the children of Israel are servants. They are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 26 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
26 “‘Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land to bow down unto it; for I am the Lord your God.
2 Ye shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary: I am the Lord.
3 “‘If ye walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them,
4 then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
8 And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful and multiply you, and establish My covenant with you.
10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
11 And I will set My tabernacle among you, and My soul shall not abhor you.
12 And I will walk among you and will be your God, and ye shall be My people.
13 I am the Lord your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
14 “‘But if ye will not hearken unto Me and will not do all these commandments,
15 and if ye shall despise My statutes, or if your soul abhor My judgments so that ye will not do all My commandments, but that ye break My covenant,
16 I also will do this unto you: I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
17 And I will set My face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies; they that hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass.
20 And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
21 “‘And if ye walk contrary unto Me and will not hearken unto Me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number, and your highways shall be desolate.
23 “‘And if ye will not be reformed by Me by these things, but will walk contrary unto Me,
24 then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
25 And I will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of My covenant; and when ye are gathered together within your cities I will send the pestilence among you, and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat and not be satisfied.
27 “‘And if ye will not for all this hearken unto Me, but walk contrary unto Me,
28 then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you.
31 And I will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
32 And I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you; and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.
34 “‘Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate and ye are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths.
35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest, because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it.
36 And upon them that are left alive of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword, and they shall fall when none pursueth.
37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
40 “‘If they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against Me, and that also they have walked contrary unto Me,
41 and that I also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies—if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,
42 then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
43 The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because they despised My judgments and because their soul abhorred My statutes.
44 And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God.
45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord.’”
46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws which the Lord made between Himself and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus 27 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
27 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: ‘When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation.
3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
4 And if it be a female, then thy valuation shall be thirty shekels.
5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old then thy valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.
6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy valuation shall be for the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
7 And if it be from sixty years old and above, if it be a male, then thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels.
8 But if he be poorer than thy valuation, then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him; according to his ability who vowed shall the priest value him.
9 “‘And if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord, all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.
10 He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
11 And if it be any unclean beast, which they do not offer as a sacrifice unto the Lord, then he shall present the beast before the priest.
12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as thou, who art the priest, valuest it, so shall it be.
13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy valuation.
14 “‘And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand.
15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add a fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his.
16 “‘And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession, then thy valuation shall be according to the seed thereof: a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
17 If he sanctify his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to thy valuation it shall stand.
18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the Year of the Jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy valuation.
19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
20 And if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
22 And if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession,
23 then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy valuation, even unto the Year of the Jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation on that day as a holy thing unto the Lord.
24 In the Year of the Jubilee the field shall return unto him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
25 And all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
26 “‘Only the firstborn of the beasts, which should be the Lord’S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Lord’S.
27 And if it is of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thy valuation and shall add a fifth part of it thereto; or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy valuation.
28 “‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.
29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed, but shall surely be put to death.
30 “‘And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’S; it is holy unto the Lord.
31 And if a man will at all redeem aught of his tithes, he shall add thereto a fifth part thereof.
32 And concerning the tithe of the herd or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, a tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.
33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.’”
34 These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
Numbers 1 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
2 “Take ye the number of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by head count
3 from twenty years old and upward, all who are able to go forth to war in Israel. Thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
4 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe, every one head of the house of his fathers.
5 And these are the names of the men who shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;
6 of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
7 of Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
8 of Issachar, Nethaneel the son of Zuar;
9 of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;
10 of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud, and of Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
11 of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni;
12 of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;
13 of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ocran;
14 of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel;
15 of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.”
16 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.
17 And Moses and Aaron took these men who are expressly named.
18 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their pedigrees according to their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward by head count.

46 even all those who were numbered were six hundred and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
47 But the Levites, according to the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
48 For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying,
49 “Only the tribe of Levi shalt thou not number, neither take the count of them among the children of Israel;
50 but thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof and over all things that belong to it. They shall bear the tabernacle and all the vessels thereof, and they shall minister unto it and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
51 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger who cometh nigh shall be put to death.
52 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.
53 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.”
54 And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses; so did they.

Numbers 3 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
3 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
2 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office.
4 And Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord when they offered strange fire before the Lord in the Wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. And Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the sight of Aaron their father.
5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
6 “Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.
7 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.
8 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.
9 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.
10 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest’s office; and the stranger who cometh nigh shall be put to death.”
11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:
12 “And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn who openeth the womb among the children of Israel. Therefore the Levites shall be Mine,
13 because all the firstborn are Mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. Mine shall they be: I am the Lord.”
14 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying:
15 “Number the children of Levi according to the house of their fathers, by their families. Every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.”
16 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord, as he was commanded.
17 And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.
18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
19 And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
20 And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.
21 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimites; these are the families of the Gershonites.
22 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those who were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.
23 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch camp behind the tabernacle westward.
24 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
25 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
26 and the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.
27 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these are the families of the Kohathites.
28 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
29 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch camp on the side of the tabernacle southward.
30 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
31 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.
32 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of those who keep the charge of the sanctuary.

35 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail; these shall pitch camp on the side of the tabernacle northward.
36 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto,
37 and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.
38 But those who encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger who cometh nigh shall be put to death.
39 All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the Lord, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward were twenty and two thousand.
40 And the Lord said unto Moses: “Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
41 And thou shalt take the Levites for Me (I am the Lord) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.”
42 And Moses numbered, as the Lord commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
43 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.
44 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
45 “Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. And the Levites shall be Mine: I am the Lord.
46 And for those who are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, who are more than the Levites,
47 thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by head count; according to the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs).
48 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.”
49 And Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those who were redeemed by the Levites.
50 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money, a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
51 And Moses gave the money of those who were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers 4 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
4 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
2 “Take a count of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, according to their families, by the house of their fathers,
3 from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all who enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.
4 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation concerned with the most holy things.
5 And when the camp moves forward, Aaron shall come and his sons, and they shall take down the covering veil and cover the ark of Testimony with it,
6 and shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.
7 And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes and the spoons and the bowls, and covers for covering; and the continual bread shall be thereon.
8 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.
9 And they shall take a cloth of blue and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps and his tongs and his snuff dishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it.
10 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put it upon a carrying pole.
11 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue and cover it with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.
12 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue and cover them with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put them on a carrying pole.
13 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon;
14 and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof wherewith they minister about it — even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basins, all the vessels of the altar — and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers’ skins and put in the staves of it.
15 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to move forward, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it; but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.
16 “And to the office of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle and of all that therein is in the sanctuary and in the vessels thereof.”
17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:
18 “Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites,
19 but thus do unto them, that they may live and not die when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden;
20 but they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.”
21 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
22 “Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families.
23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them, all who enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.
24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve and to bear burdens.
25 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers’ skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
26 and the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them; so shall they serve.
27 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.
28 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation; and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
29 “As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them according to their families, by the house of their fathers;
30 from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one who entereth into the service to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.
31 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation: the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof,
32 and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service; and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden.
33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”
34 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by the house of their fathers,
35 from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one who entereth into the service for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation;
36 and those who were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
37 These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all who might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
38 And those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families and by the house of their fathers,
39 from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one who entereth into the service for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation”
40 even those who were numbered of them throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty.
41 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all who might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the Lord.
42 And those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers,

44 even those who were numbered of them by their families, were three thousand and two hundred.
45 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
46 All those who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, according to their families and by the house of their fathers,
47 from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one who came to do the service of the ministry and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation—
48 even those who were numbered of them were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore.
49 According to the commandment of the Lord they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service and according to his burden. Thus were they numbered by him, as the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers 5 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:
2 “Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one who hath an issue and whosoever is defiled by the dead.
3 Both male and female shall ye put out. Outside the camp shall ye put them, that they defile not their camps in the midst whereof I dwell.”
4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out outside the camp; as the Lord spoke unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
6 “Speak unto the children of Israel: ‘When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit to do a trespass against the Lord, and that person be guilty,
7 then they shall confess their sin which they have done. And he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it a fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.
8 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord, even to the priest, besides the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
9 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.
10 And every man’s hallowed things shall be his; whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.’”
11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
12 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘If any man’s wife go astray and commit a trespass against him,
13 and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept secret, and she be defiled and there be no witness against her, neither be she taken in the act,
14 and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled — or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled—
15 then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest. And he shall bring her offering for her, a tenth part of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon, for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
16 “‘And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the Lord.
17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water.
18 And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering; and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse.
19 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, “If no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone astray to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse.
20 But if thou hast gone astray to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee besides thine husband”—
21 then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman — “the Lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell.
22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot.” And the woman shall say, “Amen, amen.”
23 “‘And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water;
24 and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse, and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.
25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the Lord and offer it upon the altar.
26 And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
27 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot; and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive seed.
29 “‘This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled,
30 or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the Lord, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
31 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.’”
Numbers 6 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
6 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord,
3 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes or dried.
4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
5 “‘All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head. Until the days be fulfilled in which he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
6 All the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall come near no dead body.
7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister when they die, because the consecration of his God is upon his head.
8 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the Lord.
9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day shall he shave it.
10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation;
11 and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, because he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
12 And he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering; but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
13 “‘And this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled: He shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
14 and he shall offer his offering unto the Lord: one helamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
15 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.
16 And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.
17 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also his meat offering and his drink offering.
18 And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
19 And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after the hair of his separation is shaved.
20 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord. This is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder. And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.’
21 “This is the law of the Nazirite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the Lord for his separation, besides that which his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do according to the law of his separation.”
22 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
23 “Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, ‘In this way ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them:
24 The Lord bless thee and keep thee;
25 the Lord make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee;
26 the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.’
27 “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.”
Numbers 7 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
7 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them,
2 that the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes and were over those who were numbered, offered.
3 And they brought their offering before the Lord: six covered wagons and twelve oxen — a wagon for two of the princes and for each one an ox; and they brought them before the tabernacle.
4 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
5 “Take it from them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.”
6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.
7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service;
8 and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.
10 And the princes offered for the dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.
11 And the Lord said unto Moses, “They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.”

Numbers 8 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
8 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him: ‘When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.’”
3 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the Lord commanded Moses.
4 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold; unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work. According unto the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses, so he made the candlestick.
5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
6 “Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them.
7 And thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.
8 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.
9 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation, and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together.
10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites.
11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the Lord.
12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks, and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the Lord to make an atonement for the Levites.
13 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the Lord.
14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.
15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for an offering.
16 For they are wholly given unto Me from among the children of Israel, instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel have I taken them unto Me.
17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are Mine, both man and beast. On the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself.
18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.”
20 And Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites according unto all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites; so did the children of Israel unto them.
21 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord, and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.
22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron and before his sons. As the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.
23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
24 “This is what applies unto the Levites: From twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more,
26 but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites concerning their charge.”
Numbers 9 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
2 “Let the children of Israel also keep the Passover at his appointed season.
3 In the fourteenth day of this month at evening ye shall keep it in his appointed season. According to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it.”
4 And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
5 And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at evening in the Wilderness of Sinai. According to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
6 And there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
7 And those men said unto him, “We are defiled by the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in its appointed season among the children of Israel?”
8 And Moses said unto them, “Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you.”
9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
10 “Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: ‘If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the Passover unto the Lord.
11 The fourteenth day of the second month at evening they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it.
13 But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he brought not the offering of the Lord in its appointed season. That man shall bear his sin.
14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the Passover unto the Lord, according to the ordinance of the Passover and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do. Ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land.’”
15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony; and at evening there was upon the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire until the morning.
16 So it was always: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.
17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud stood still, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
18 At the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched camp. As long as the cloud stayed upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents;
19 and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord and journeyed not.
20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle, according to the commandment of the Lord they stayed in their tents, and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed.
21 And so it was, when the cloud tarried from evening unto the morning, and the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed. Whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
22 Or whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel remained in their tents and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
23 At the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed. They kept the charge of the Lord, at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
Numbers 10 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
10 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Make thee two trumpets of silver. Of a whole piece shalt thou make them, that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps.
3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, who are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
10 Also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the Lord your God.”
11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the testimony.
12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the Wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the Wilderness of Paran.
13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies; and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari moved forward, bearing the tabernacle.
18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben moved forward according to their armies; and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
21 And the Kohathites moved forward, bearing the sanctuary; and the others set up the tabernacle for when they came.
22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim moved forward according to their armies; and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan moved forward, which was the rearmost of all the camps throughout their hosts; and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies when they moved forward.
29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law: “We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.”
30 And he said unto him, “I will not go, but I will depart to mine own land and to my kindred.”
31 And he said, “Leave us not, I pray thee, inasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.
32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.”
33 And they departed from the mount of the Lord three days’ journey, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days’ journey to search out a resting place for them.
34 And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day when they went out of the camp.
35 And it came to pass, when the ark moved forward, that Moses said, “Rise up, Lord, and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee.”
36 And when it rested he said, “Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel.”
Numbers 11 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
11 And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord; and the Lord heard it, and His anger was kindled. And the fire of the Lord burned among them, and consumed those who were in the uttermost parts of the camp.
2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched.
3 And he called the name of the place Taberah [that is, A burning], because the fire of the Lord burned among them.
4 And the mixed multitude that was among them fell to lusting. And the children of Israel also wept again and said, “Who shall give us flesh to eat?
5 We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;
6 but our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes.”
7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the color of bdellium.
8 And the people went about and gathered it, and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent. And the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
11 And Moses said unto the Lord, “Why hast Thou afflicted Thy servant? And why have I not found favor in Thy sight, that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
12 Have I conceived all this people? Have I begotten them, that Thou shouldest say unto me, ‘Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which Thou swearest unto their fathers’?
13 From whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? For they weep unto me, saying, ‘Give us flesh, that we may eat.’
14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
15 And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in Thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness!”
16 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.
17 And I will come down and talk with thee there. And I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
18 And say thou unto the people: ‘Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh. For ye have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, “Who shall give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore the Lord will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
20 but even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you, because ye have despised the Lord who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, “Why came we forth out of Egypt?”’”
21 And Moses said, “The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen; and Thou hast said, ‘I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.’
22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them?”
23 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Has the Lord’S hand waxed short? Thou shalt see now whether My word shall come to pass unto thee or not.”
24 And Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle.
25 And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders; and it came to pass that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
26 But there remained two of the men in the camp: the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of those who were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle; and they prophesied in the camp.
27 And there ran a young man and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.”
28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, “My lord Moses, forbid them!”
29 And Moses said unto him, “Enviest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord’S people were prophets, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!”
30 And Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
31 And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.
32 And the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day, and they gathered the quails. He that gathered least gathered ten homers, and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague.
34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah [that is, The graves of lust], because there they buried the people who lusted.
35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth, and abode at Hazeroth.
Numbers 12 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
12 And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married, for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
2 And they said, “Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath He not spoken also by us?” And the Lord heard it.
3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.)
4 And the Lord spoke suddenly unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam: “Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation.” And the three came out.
5 And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
6 And He said, “Hear now My words: If there be a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will make Myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.
7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all Mine house.
8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold. Why then were ye not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?”
9 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and He departed.
10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle. And behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow; and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
11 And Aaron said unto Moses, “Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned.
12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.”
13 And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, “Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee.”
14 And the Lord said unto Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.”
15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days, and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth and pitched camp in the Wilderness of Paran.
Numbers 13 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
13 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.”
3 And Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the Wilderness of Paran. All those men were heads of the children of Israel.
4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
5 of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
6 of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
7 of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
8 of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
9 of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
10 of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
11 of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;
12 of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
13 of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
14 of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
15 of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.
17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, “Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain.
18 And see the land, what it is, and the people who dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;
19 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad, and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds;
20 and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
21 So they went up and searched the land from the Wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
22 And they ascended by the south and came unto Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs.
24 The place was called the Brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
26 And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of Paran to Kadesh, and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
27 And they told him, and said, “We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
28 Nevertheless the people are strong who dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and very great; and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of the Jordan.”
30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it.”
31 But the men who went up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.”
32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, who come of the giants. And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”
Numbers 14 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
14 And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried, and the people wept that night.
2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said unto them, “Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would God we had died in this wilderness!
3 And why hath the Lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? Were it not better for us to return into Egypt?”
4 And they said one to another, “Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.”
5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who searched the land, rent their clothes;
7 and they spoke unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, “The land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land.
8 If the Lord delight in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which floweth with milk and honey.
9 Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their defense has departed from them, and the Lord is with us. Fear them not.”
10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
11 And the Lord said unto Moses, “How long will this people provoke Me? And how long will it be ere they believe Me for all the signs which I have shown among them?
12 I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.”
13 And Moses said unto the Lord, “Then the Egyptians shall hear it (for Thou broughtest up this people in Thy might from among them),
14 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land; for they have heard that Thou, Lord, art among this people, that Thou, Lord, art seen face to face, and that Thy cloud standeth over them, and that Thou goest before them by daytime in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night.
15 Now if Thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of Thee will speak, saying,
16 ‘Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore unto them, therefore He hath slain them in the wilderness.’
17 And now, I beseech Thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as Thou hast spoken, saying,
18 ‘The Lord is longsuffering and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.’
19 Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.”
20 And the Lord said, “I have pardoned according to thy word;
21 but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.
22 Because all those men who have seen My glory and My miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted Me now these ten times and have not hearkened to My voice—
23 surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of those who provoked Me see it.
24 But My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him and hath followed Me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went, and his seed shall possess it.”
25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) “Tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”
26 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
27 “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who murmur against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against Me.
28 Say unto them, ‘As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in Mine ears, so will I do to you.
29 Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against Me,
30 doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
31 But your little ones, whom ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
32 But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years and bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.
34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, for each day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know My altering of My purpose.
35 I, the Lord, have said: I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.’”
36 And the men, whom Moses sent to search the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land,
37 even those men who brought up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the Lord.
38 But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of the men who went to search the land, lived still.
39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
40 And they rose up early in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, “Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised; for we have sinned.”
41 And Moses said, “Why now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord? But it shall not prosper.
42 Go not up, for the Lord is not among you, that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword. Because ye have turned away from the Lord, therefore the Lord will not be with you.”
44 But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop. Nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp.
45 Then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites who dwelt in that hill, and smote them and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.
Numbers 15 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
15 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘When ye have come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,
3 and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor unto the Lord of the herd or of the flock,
4 then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth part of flour mingled with a fourth part of a hin of oil.
5 And a fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.
6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenths part of flour mingled with a third part of a hin of oil.
7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer a third part of a hin of wine for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord,
9 then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenths part of flour mingled with half a hin of oil.
10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
11 “‘Thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a lamb or a kid.
12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
13 All who are born of the country shall do these things in this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the Lord, as ye do, so he shall do.
15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger who sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations. As ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord:
16 one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourneth with you.’”
17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
18 “Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
19 then it shall be that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave offering unto the Lord.
20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for a heave offering; as ye do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall ye heave it.
21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord a heave offering in your generations.
22 And if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses—
23 even all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord commanded Moses and henceforward among your generations—
24 then it shall be, if aught be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the Lord with his meat offering and his drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.
25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it is ignorance; and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, and their sin offering before the Lord, for their ignorance.
26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who sojourneth among them, seeing all the people were in ignorance.
27 “‘And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a shegoat of the first year for a sin offering.
28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul who sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourneth among them.
30 But the soul who doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in the land or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
31 Because he hath despised the word of the Lord and hath broken His commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off. His iniquity shall be upon him.’”
32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man who gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day.
33 And those who found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregation.
34 And they put him under guard, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
35 And the Lord said unto Moses, “The man shall be surely put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.”
36 And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the Lord commanded Moses.
37 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
38 “Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue.
39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them, and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring,
40 that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God.
41 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the Lord your God.”
Numbers 16 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
16 Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men;
2 and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown.
3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, “Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Why then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord?”
4 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face;
5 and he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, “Even tomorrow the Lord will show who are His and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto Him. Even him whom He hath chosen will He cause to come near unto Him.
6 This do: Take you censers, Korah and all his company,
7 and put fire therein and put incense in them before the Lord tomorrow. And it shall be that the man whom the Lord doth choose, he shall be holy. Ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.”
8 And Moses said unto Korah, “Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?
10 And He hath brought thee near to Him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee. And seek ye the priesthood also?
11 For this cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord. And what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?”
12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, who said, “We will not come up.
13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, unless thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
14 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”
15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the Lord, “Respect not Thou their offering. I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.”
16 And Moses said unto Korah, “Be thou and all thy company before the Lord, thou and they and Aaron, tomorrow.
17 And take every man his censer and put incense in them, and bring ye before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, thou also and Aaron, each of you his censer.”
18 And they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation.
20 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
21 “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.”
22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt Thou be wroth with all the congregation?”
23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
24 “Speak unto the congregation, saying, ‘Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”
25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
26 And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, “Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.”
27 So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives and their sons and their little children.
28 And Moses said, “Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of mine own mind.
29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited according to the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me.
30 But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord.”
31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground cleaved asunder that was under them;
32 and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses and all the men who appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.
33 They and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them; and they perished from among the congregation.
34 And all Israel who were round about them fled at the cry of them, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up also!”
35 And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense.
36 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
37 “Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder, for they are hallowed.
38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them into broad plates for a covering of the altar; for they offered them before the Lord. Therefore they are hallowed, and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.”
39 And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith those who were burned had offered, and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar
40 to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the Lord; that he be not as Korah and as his company, as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses.
41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “Ye have killed the people of the Lord.”
42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation; and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.
43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
44 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
45 “Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment.” And they fell upon their faces.
46 And Moses said unto Aaron, “Take a censer and put fire therein from the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them. For there has wrath gone out from the Lord; the plague has begun.”
47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague had begun among the people. And he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
49 Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died in the matter of Korah.
50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the plague was stayed.
Numbers 17 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Speak unto the children of Israel, and take from every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, from all their princes according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods. Write thou every man’s name upon his rod.
3 And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi, for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the Testimony, where I will meet with you.
5 And it shall come to pass that the man’s rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.”
6 And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
7 And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness.
8 And it came to pass that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds.
9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod.
10 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Bring Aaron’s rod again before the Testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from Me, that they die not.”
11 And Moses did so; as the Lord commanded him, so did he.
12 And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying, “Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish!
13 Whosoever cometh anywhere near unto the tabernacle of the Lord shall die. Shall we be consumed with dying?”
Numbers 18 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
18 And the Lord said unto Aaron: “Thou and thy sons and thy father’s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee; but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
3 And they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle; only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle; and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel. To you they are given as a gift for the Lord, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s office for every thing of the altar and within the veil; and ye shall serve. I have given your priest’s office unto you as a service of gift, and the stranger who cometh nigh shall be put to death.”
8 And the Lord spoke unto Aaron: “Behold, I also have given thee the charge of Mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel. Unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
9 This shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto Me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy unto thee.
11 And this is thine: the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever; every one who is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord, them have I given thee.
13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the Lord, shall be thine. Every one who is clean in thine house shall eat of it.
14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
15 Every thing that openeth the womb in all flesh, which they bring unto the Lord, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine. Nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs.
17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem. They are holy. Thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.
19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the Lord, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever. It is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee.”
20 And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, “Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
21 And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin and die.
23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit. Therefore I have said unto them: ‘Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.’”
25 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
26 “Thus speak unto the Levites and say unto them: ‘When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe.
27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the wine press.
28 Thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes, which ye receive from the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the Lord’S heave offering to Aaron the priest.
29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.’
30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them: ‘When ye have offered the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor and as the increase of the wine press.
31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households, for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have offered from it the best of it; neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.’”
Numbers 19 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
19 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
2 “This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded, saying: ‘Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke.
3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth outside the camp, and one shall slay her before his face.
4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times.
5 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight: her skin and her flesh and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.
6 And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water; and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
9 And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger who sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
11 “‘He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
12 He shall purify himself with the water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man who is dead and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
14 “‘This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: All who come into the tent, and all who are in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
16 And whosoever toucheth one who is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel.
18 And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons who were there, and upon him that touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave.
19 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.
20 “‘But the man who shall be unclean and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. The water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him: he is unclean.
21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until evening.
22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean, and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until evening.’”
Numbers 20 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
20 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the Desert of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh. And Miriam died there, and was buried there.
2 And there was no water for the congregation, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
3 And the people chided Moses and spoke, saying, “Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord!
4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
5 And why have ye made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place? It is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.”
6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.
7 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
8 “Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.”
9 And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as He commanded him.
10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them: “Hear now, ye rebels! Must we fetch you water out of this rock?”
11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice; and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
12 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron: “Because ye believed Me not, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.”
13 This is the water of Meribah [that is, Strife], because the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and He was sanctified in them.
14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom: “Thus saith thy brother Israel: ‘Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us,
15 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers.
16 And when we cried unto the Lord, He heard our voice and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt. And behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.
17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country. We will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders.’”
18 And Edom said unto him: “Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.”
19 And the children of Israel said unto him, “We will go by the highway; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it. I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet.”
20 And he said, “Thou shalt not go through.” And Edom came out against him with many people and with a strong hand.
21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border. Therefore Israel turned away from him.
22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and came unto Mount Hor.
23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
24 “Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah.
25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto Mount Hor.
26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there.”
27 And Moses did as the Lord commanded, and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount;
29 and when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
Numbers 21 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
21 And when King Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies, then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoners.
2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, “If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”
3 And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. And he called the name of the place Hormah [that is, Utter Destruction].
4 And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea to compass the land of Edom, and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
5 And the people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.”
6 And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.
7 Therefore the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee. Pray unto the Lord, that He take away the serpents from us.” And Moses prayed for the people.
8 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole. And it shall come to pass that every one who is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.”
9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived.
10 And the children of Israel went forward, and pitched camp in Oboth.
11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab toward the sunrising.
12 From thence they removed, and pitched camp in the Valley of Zered.
13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the border of the Amorites; for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
14 Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord what He did in the Red Sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
15 and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar and lieth upon the border of Moab.
16 And from thence they went to Beer. That is the well whereof the Lord spoke unto Moses: “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”
17 Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well! Sing ye unto it!
18 The princes dug the well; the nobles of the people dug it by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves.” And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,
19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
20 and from Bamoth in the valley that is in the country of Moab to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
22 “Let me pass through thy land. We will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well, but we will go along by the king’s highway until we be past thy borders.”
23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border. But Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
25 And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say: “Come into Heshbon; let the city of Sihon be built and prepared.
28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
29 Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh! He hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity, unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon. And we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.”
31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
32 And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites who were there.
33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
34 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Fear him not, for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people and his land. And thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.”
35 So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him alive; and they possessed his land.
Numbers 22 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
22 And the children of Israel went forward, and pitched camp in the plains of Moab on this side of the Jordan by Jericho.
2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, “Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.
6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse for me this people;for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.”
7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand, and they came unto Balaam and spoke unto him the words of Balak.
8 And he said unto them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word back, as the Lord shall speak unto me.” And the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
9 And God came unto Balaam and said, “What men are these with thee?”
10 And Balaam said unto God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,
11 ‘Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, who covereth the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out.’”
12 And God said unto Balaam, “Thou shalt not go with them. Thou shalt not curse the people, for they are blessed.”
13 And Balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of Balak, “Get you into your land, for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you.”
14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak and said, “Balaam refuseth to come with us.”
15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
16 And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor: ‘Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me;
17 for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me. Come therefore, I pray thee, curse for me this people.’”
18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more.
19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what more the Lord will say unto me.”
20 And God came unto Balaam at night and said unto him, “If the men come to call thee, rise up and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.”
21 And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
22 And God’s anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the Lord stood in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
23 And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand. And the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field, and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way.
24 But the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side and a wall on that side.
25 And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall; and he smote her again.
26 And the angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
27 And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she fell down under Balaam; and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
28 And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, “What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?”
29 And Balaam said unto the ass, “Because thou hast mocked me. I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.”
30 And the ass said unto Balaam, “Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? Was I ever wont to do so unto thee?” And he said, “Nay.”
31 Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
32 And the angel of the Lord said unto him, “Why hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? Behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me.
33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times. Unless she had turned from me, surely now also I would have slain thee and saved her alive.”
34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord, “I have sinned, for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.”
35 And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, “Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou speak.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
36 And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost border.
37 And Balak said unto Balaam, “Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? Why camest thou not unto me? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?”
38 And Balaam said unto Balak, “Lo, I have come unto thee. Have I now any power at all to say anything? The word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.”
39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and to the princes who were with him.
41 And it came to pass on the morrow that Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.
Numbers 23 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
23 And Balaam said unto Balak, “Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.”
2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
3 And Balaam said unto Balak, “Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me, and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee.” And he went to a high place.
4 And God met Balaam; and he said unto Him, “I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.”
5 And the Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.”
6 And he returned unto him, and lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the princes of Moab.
7 And he took up his parable and said: “Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, ‘Come, curse for me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.’
8 How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed? Or how shall I defy whom the Lord hath not defied?
9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him; lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!”
11 And Balak said unto Balaam, “What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.”
12 And he answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?”
13 And Balak said unto him, “Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them. Thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse them for me from thence.”
14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
15 And he said unto Balak, “Stand here by thy burnt offering while I meet the Lord yonder.”
16 And the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth and said, “Go again unto Balak, and say thus.”
17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, “What hath the Lord spoken?”
18 And he took up his parable and said: “Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor.
19 God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent. Hath He said, and shall He not do it? Or hath He spoken, and shall He not make it good?
20 Behold, I have received commandment to bless; and He hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel; the Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a King is among them.
22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath, as it were, the strength of a unicorn.
23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel. According to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, ‘What hath God wrought!’
24 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion; he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain.”
25 And Balak said unto Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”
26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, “Told not I thee, saying, ‘All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do’?”
27 And Balak said unto Balaam, “Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place. Perhaps it will please God that thou mayest curse them for me from thence.”
28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.
29 And Balaam said unto Balak, “Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.”
30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers 24 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
24 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek out enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
3 And he took up his parable and said: “Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said,
4 he hath said, who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
5 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!
6 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lignaloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.
7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters; and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath, as it were, the strength of a unicorn. He shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows.
9 He couched, he lay down as a lion. And as a great lion, who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.”
10 And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, “I called thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place. I thought to promote thee unto great honor, but lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honor.”
12 And Balaam said unto Balak, “Spoke I not also to thy messengers whom thou sentest unto me, saying,
13 ‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak’?
14 And now, behold, I go unto my people. Come therefore, and I will warn thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.”
15 And he took up his parable and said: “Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said,
16 he hath said, who heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most High, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
17 I shall see Him, but not now; I shall behold Him, but not nigh. There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of Sheth.
18 And Edom shall be a possession; Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies, and Israel shall do valiantly.
19 Out of Jacob shall come He that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.”
20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable and said: “Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.”
21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable and said: “Strong is thy dwelling place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.”
23 And he took up his parable and said: “Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
24 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.”
25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
Numbers 25 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
25 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
3 And Israel joined himself unto Baal of Peor, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.
4 And the Lord said unto Moses, “Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel.”
5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, “Slay ye every one his men who were joined unto Baal of Peor.”
6 And behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
7 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand;
8 and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
9 And those who died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
10 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
11 “Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned My wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for My sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in My jealousy.
12 Therefore say: ‘Behold, I give unto him My covenant of peace.
13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.’”
14 Now the name of the Israelite who was slain, even who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
15 And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head over a people and of a chief housein Midian.
16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
17 “Vex the Midianites and smite them.
18 For they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s sake.”

3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho, saying,

3 “Our father died in the wilderness; and he was not in the company of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah, but died in his own sin and had no sons.
4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.”
5 And Moses brought their cause before the Lord.
6 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
7 “The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
8 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
9 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
10 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.
11 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses.’”

20 And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
21 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord. At his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.”

23 And he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.
Numbers 28 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)

2 “Command the children of Israel and say unto them: ‘My offering and My bread for My sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Me, shall ye observe to offer unto Me in their due season.’
3 And thou shalt say unto them: ‘This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the Lord: two lambs of the first year without spot, day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
4 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at evening,
5 and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering mingled with a fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
6 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord.
7 And the drink offering thereof shall be a fourth part of a hin for the one lamb; in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering.
8 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at evening; as the meat offering of the morning and as the drink offering thereof thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
9 “‘And on the Sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and twotenths part of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof.

15 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the Lord shall be offered, besides the continual burnt offering and his drink offering.
16 “‘And on the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover of the Lord.
17 And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
18 On the first day shall be a holy convocation. Ye shall do no manner of servile work therein,
19 but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the Lord: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year. They shall be unto you without blemish.
20 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: threetenths part shall ye offer for a bullock, and twotenths part for a ram,

23 Ye shall offer these besides the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.
24 In this manner ye shall offer daily throughout the seven days the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. It shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and his drink offering.

26 “‘Also on the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the Lord, after your weeks be out, ye shall have a holy convocation. Ye shall do no servile work,
27 but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the Lord: two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year,

40 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the Lord commanded Moses.
Numbers 30 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
30 And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded:
2 If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
3 “If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father’s house in her youth,
4 and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace with her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand; and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
6 And if she had a husband, when she vowed or uttered aught out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul,
7 and her husband heard it and held his peace with her in the day that he heard it, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it, then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul, of no effect; and the Lord shall forgive her.
9 But every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
10 And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
11 and her husband heard it and held his peace with her and disallowed her not, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband hath made them void, and the Lord shall forgive her.
13 Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace with her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her; he confirmeth them, because he held his peace with her in the day that he heard them.
15 But if he shall any way make them void after he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.”
16 These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father’s house.
Numbers 31 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
31 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Avenge the children of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.”
3 And Moses spoke unto the people, saying, “Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites and avenge the Lord on Midian.
4 From every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.”
5 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe — them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war, with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
8 And they slew the kings of Midian besides the rest of those who were slain, namely: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian. Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captive, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods.
10 And they burned all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly strongholds with fire.
11 And they took all the spoil and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
12 And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto Moses and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan near Jericho.
13 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them outside the camp.
14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, who came from the battle.
15 And Moses said unto them, “Have ye saved all the women alive?
16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.
17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who hath known a man by lying with him.
18 But all the women children, who have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
19 And abide ye outside the camp seven days. Whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.
20 And purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood.”
21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war who went to the battle, “This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses:
22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
23 every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation. And all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.”
25 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
26 “Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation;
27 and divide the prey into two parts, between those who took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation.
28 And levy a tribute unto the Lord on the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep.
29 Take it from their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest for a heave offering of the Lord.
30 And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.”
31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.
32 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
33 and threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
34 and threescore and one thousand asses,
35 and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women who had not known a man by lying with him.
36 And the half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep;
37 and the Lord’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand, of which the Lord’S tribute was threescore and twelve.
39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred, of which the Lord’S tribute was threescore and one.
40 And the persons were sixteen thousand, of which the Lord’S tribute was thirty and two persons.
41 And Moses gave the tribute which was the Lord’S heave offering unto Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.
42 And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men who warred
43 (now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
44 and thirty and six thousand beeves,
45 and thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
46 and sixteen thousand persons),
47 even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
48 And the officers who were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came near Moses;
49 and they said unto Moses, “Thy servants have taken the count of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the Lord.”
51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, even all wrought jewels.
52 And all the gold from the offering that they offered up to the Lord, of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
53 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord.
Numbers 32 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
32 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle; and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for cattle,
2 the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke unto Moses and to Eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
3 “Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
4 even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.”
5 Therefore, said they, “If we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over the Jordan.”
6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, “Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
7 And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them?
8 Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
9 For when they went up unto the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them.
10 And the Lord’S anger was kindled the same time, and He swore, saying,
11 ‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, because they have not wholly followed Me,
12 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun; for they have wholly followed the Lord.’
13 And the Lord’S anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed.
14 And behold, ye have risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.
15 For if ye turn away from after Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness, and ye shall destroy all this people.”
16 And they came near unto him and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks and cities for our little ones,
17 but we ourselves will go ready and armed before the children of Israel until we have brought them unto their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
18 We will not return unto our houses until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side of the Jordan or forward, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.”
20 And Moses said unto them, “If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the Lord to war,
21 and will go all of you armed over the Jordan before the Lord, until He hath driven out His enemies from before Him
22 and the land be subdued before the Lord, then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the Lord and before Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the Lord.
23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord; and be sure your sin will find you out.
24 Build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.”
25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke unto Moses, saying, “Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
27 but thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.”
28 So concerning them, Moses commanded Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.
29 And Moses said unto them, “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man armed for battle before the Lord and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”
31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, “As the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.
32 We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side of the Jordan may be ours.”
33 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with the cities thereof in the borders, even the cities of the country round about.
34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
35 and Atroth, Shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,
36 and Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
38 and Nebo, and Baalmeon (their names being changed), and Shibmah, and gave other names unto the cities which they built.
39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt therein.
41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.
42 And Nobah went and took Kenath and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
Numbers 33 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
33 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the Lord, and these are their journeys according to their goings out:
3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the morrow after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,
4 for the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, whom the Lord had smitten among them. Upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments.
5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses and pitched camp in Succoth.
6 And they departed from Succoth and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.
7 And they removed from Etham and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baalzephon; and they pitched before Migdol.
8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days’ journey in the Wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.
9 And they removed from Marah and came unto Elim; and in Elim were twelve fountains of water and threescore and ten palm trees, and they pitched there.
10 And they removed from Elim and encamped by the Red Sea.
11 And they removed from the Red Sea and encamped in the Wilderness of Sin.
12 And they took their journey out of the Wilderness of Sin and encamped in Dophkah.
13 And they departed from Dophkah and encamped in Alush.
14 And they removed from Alush and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.
15 And they departed from Rephidim and pitched camp in the Wilderness of Sinai.
16 And they removed from the Desert of Sinai and pitched at Kibrothhattaavah [that is, The graves of lust].
17 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah and encamped at Hazeroth.
18 And they departed from Hazeroth and pitched in Rithmah.
19 And they departed from Rithmah and pitched at Rimmonperez.
20 And they departed from Rimmonperez and pitched in Libnah.
21 And they removed from Libnah and pitched at Rissah.
22 And they journeyed from Rissah and pitched in Kehelathah.
23 And they went from Kehelathah and pitched in Mount Shepher.
24 And they removed from Mount Shepher and encamped in Haradah.
25 And they removed from Haradah and pitched in Makheloth.
26 And they removed from Makheloth and encamped at Tahath.
27 And they departed from Tahath and pitched at Terah.
28 And they removed from Terah and pitched in Mithkah.
29 And they went from Mithkah and pitched in Hashmonah.
30 And they departed from Hashmonah and encamped at Moseroth.
31 And they departed from Moseroth and pitched in Benejaakan.
32 And they removed from Benejaakan and encamped at Horhagidgad.
33 And they went from Horhagidgad and pitched in Jotbathah.
34 And they removed from Jotbathah and encamped at Abronah.
35 And they departed from Abronah and encamped at Eziongeber.
36 And they removed from Eziongeber and pitched in the Wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
37 And they removed from Kadesh and pitched in Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom.
38 And Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord, and died there in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month.
39 And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
40 And King Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
41 And they departed from Mount Hor and pitched camp in Zalmonah.
42 And they departed from Zalmonah and pitched in Punon.
43 And they departed from Punon and pitched in Oboth.
44 And they departed from Oboth and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab.
45 And they departed from Iim and pitched in Dibongad.
46 And they removed from Dibongad and encamped in Almondiblathaim.
47 And they removed from Almondiblathaim and pitched in the mountains of Abarim before Nebo.
48 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim and pitched in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho.
49 And they pitched by the Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.
50 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho, saying,
51 “Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: ‘When ye have passed over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
52 then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their idols, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places.
53 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein, for I have given you the land to possess it.
54 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families; and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance. Every man’s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth, according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
55 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that those who ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
56 Moreover it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them.’”
Numbers 34 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
34 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 “Command the children of Israel, and say unto them: ‘When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the borders thereof),
3 then your south quarter shall be from the Wilderness of Zin along by the border of Edom; and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the Salt Sea eastward.
4 And your border shall turn from the south to the Ascent of Akrabbim and pass on to Zin; and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar and pass on to Azmon.
5 And the border shall pass around from Azmon unto the River of Egypt, and the limits of it shall be at the Sea.
6 “‘And as for the western border, ye shall even have the Great Sea for a border. This shall be your west border.
7 “‘And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea ye shall designate for you Mount Hor;
8 from Mount Hor ye shall designate your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the limits of the border shall be to Zedad;
9 and the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the limits of it shall be at Hazarenan. This shall be your north border.
10 “‘And ye shall designate your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham;
11 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend and shall reach unto the side of the Sea of Chinnereth eastward;
12 and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the limits of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land with the borders thereof round about.’”
13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, “This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the Lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes and to the halftribe.
14 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
15 The two tribes and the halftribe have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.”
16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
17 “These are the names of the men who shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land by inheritance.
19 And the names of the men are these: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
20 and of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud;
21 of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;
22 and the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli;
23 the princes of the children of Joseph: for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod,
24 and the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;
25 and the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach;
26 and the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan;
27 and the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi;
28 and the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”
29 These are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers 35 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
35 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho, saying,
2 “Command the children of Israel that they give unto the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.
3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in, and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beasts.
4 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
5 And ye shall measure from outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
6 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither; and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.
7 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; these shall ye give with their suburbs.
8 And the cities which ye shall give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel. From those who have many ye shall give many, but from those who have few ye shall give few. Every one shall give from his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.”
9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
10 “Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: ‘When ye have come over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
11 then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the slayer may flee thither who killeth any person unawares.
12 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment.
13 And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge.
14 Ye shall give three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
15 These six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, that every one who killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
16 “‘And if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
18 Or if he smite him with a hand weapon of wood wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
19 The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer; when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
20 But if he thrust him out of hatred, or hurl at him by lying in wait so that he die,
21 or in enmity smite him with his hand so that he die, he that smote him shall surely be put to death, for he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him.
22 “‘But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him anything without lying in wait,
23 or with any stone wherewith a man may die, seeing him not and casting it upon him so that he die, and was not his enemy neither sought his harm,
24 then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments.
25 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he had fled; and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
26 But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge whither he had fled,
27 and the avenger of blood find him outside the borders of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the slayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,
28 because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
29 “‘So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
31 Moreover ye shall take no payment for the life of a murderer who is deserving of death, but he shall be surely put to death.
32 And ye shall take no payment for him that has fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest.
33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein I dwell; for I, the Lord, dwell among the children of Israel.’”
Numbers 36 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
36 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel.
2 And they said, “The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
4 And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”
5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord, saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
6 This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them marry whom they think best; only, within the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.’
7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe, for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
8 And every daughter who possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe, but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.”
10 Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad;
11 for Mahlal, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fathers’ brothers’ sons.
12 And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
13 These are the commandments and the judgments which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho.
Deuteronomy 1 21st Century King James Version (KJ21)
1 These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite the Red Sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
2 (There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)
3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them,
4 after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei.
5 On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
6 “The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: ’Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount.
7 Turn you and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills and in the vale, and in the South and by the seaside, to the land of the Canaanites and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the River Euphrates.
8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.’
9 “And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, ‘I am not able to bear you myself alone.
10 The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
11 (The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you as He hath promised you!)
12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife?
13 Take you wise men of understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.’
14 And ye answered me and said, ‘The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.’
15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger who is with him.
17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but ye shall hear the small as well as the great. Ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. And the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me and I will hear it.’
18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
19 “And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.
20 And I said unto you, ‘Ye have come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.
21 Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee. Go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.’
22 “And ye came near unto me, every one of you, and said, ‘We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come.’
23 And the saying pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one from a tribe.
24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the Valley of Eshcol and searched it out.
25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, ‘It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us.’
26 “Notwithstanding, ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God;
27 and ye murmured in your tents and said, ‘Because the Lord hated us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
28 Whither shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, “The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven, and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.”’
29 Then I said unto you, ‘Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
30 The Lord your God who goeth before you, He shall fight for you according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
31 and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how the Lord thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place.’
32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God,
33 who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
34 “And the Lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth, and swore, saying,
35 ‘Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I swore to give unto your fathers,
36 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord.’
37 Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, ‘Thou also shalt not go in thither.
38 But Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
39 Moreover your little ones, who ye said should be a prey, and your children, who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither; and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.’
41 “Then ye answered and said unto me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us.’ And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up onto the hill.
42 And the Lord said unto me, ‘Say unto them: Go not up, neither fight, for I am not among you, lest ye be smitten before your enemies.’
43 So I spoke unto you, and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, and went presumptuously up onto the hill.
44 And the Amorites, who dwelt in that mountain, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.
45 And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.
